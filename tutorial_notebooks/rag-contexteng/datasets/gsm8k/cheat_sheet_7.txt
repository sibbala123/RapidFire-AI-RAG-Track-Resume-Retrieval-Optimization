Let's say that N is what Nada has, J is what John has, and A is what Ali has. We know that A = N - 5 and J = 4N.
We also know that: N + A + J = $67
We can substitute the equations from step 1 into the equations from step 2 to get: N + 4N + (N-5) = $67
Combining like terms gets us 6N - 5 = $67
So, N=($67+5)/6 = $12
Substituting $12 back into the equation J = 4 N, we find John has 4 x 12 = $<<4*12=48>>48

Let B be the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the third set.
In the second set, he retrieved 2B balls.
In the first set, he retrieved 2B + 4 balls.
In total, he retrieved B + 2B + 2B + 4 = 5B + 4 = 19 balls.
Thus, 5B = 19 - 4 = 15 balls.
Therefore, in the third set, Rory retrieved B = 15 / 5 = <<15/5=3>>3 balls.

Each pack of bacon costs Kelly $10 total / 5 packs of bacon = $<<10/5=2>>2.
So each pack of chicken costs $2 per pack of bacon * 2 = $<<2*2=4>>4.
All of the chicken will therefore cost 6 packets of chicken * $4 per pack of chicken = $<<6*4=24>>24.
The strawberries will cost her 3 packs of strawberries * $4 per pack of strawberries = $<<3*4=12>>12.
Each pack of apples costs Kelly $4 per pack of strawberries / 2 = $<<4/2=2>>2.
So all of the apples will cost her a combined total of 7 packs of apples * $2 per pack of apples = $<<7*2=14>>14.
In total, Kelly’s shopping so far costs $10 for bacon + $24 for chicken + $12 for strawberries + $14 for apples = $<<10+24+12+14=60>>60.
She therefore has $65 budget - $60 for shopping = $<<65-60=5>>5 left in the budget.

First calculate the gross annual salary for Job A: 2000 hours * $15/hour = $<<2000*15=30000>>30,000
Next, calculate the amount of taxes Nick pays at Job A by multiplying his net salary by the 20% tax rate: .2 * $30,000 = $<<30000*.2=6000>>6,000
Now subtract Nick's taxes from his net pay to find his gross pay at Job A: $30,000 - $6,000 = $<<30000-6000=24000>>24,000
Now subtract Nick's property taxes from his gross income at Job B: $42,000 - $6,000 = $<<42000-6000=36000>>36,000
Now multiply Nick's income after property tax by 10% to find his income tax at Job B: $36,000 * 10% = $<<36000*10*.01=3600>>3,600
Now subtract the income tax amount from Nick's earnings after property tax to find his net income at Job B: $36,000 - $3,600 = $<<36000-3600=32400>>32,400
Now subtract the net income from the lower-paying job (A) from the net income from the higher-paying job (B): $32,400 - $24,000 = $<<32400-24000=8400>>8,400

We can find how long the hare spends running by dividing the distance of the race by the hare's speed: 20 feet / 10 feet/second = <<20/10=2>>2 seconds
We can do the same for the turtle: 20 feet / 1 foot/second = <<20/1=20>>20 seconds
Finally, subtract the hare's run time from the turtle's run time to find the length of the head start the turtle needs: 20 seconds - 2 seconds = <<20-2=18>>18 seconds
#### 18

If the third leg of Rick's trip was half the distance of the first leg, was 40 miles, this means the first leg was 40*2=<<40*2=80>>80 miles long
If the second leg of the trip was twice the distance of the first leg, that means it was 80*2=<<80*2=160>>160 miles long
If the fourth leg was equal in distance to the total amount traveled across the first 3 legs, that means it was equal to 40+80+160= <<280=280>>280 miles long
This means in total Rick traveled 280+280= <<280+280=560>>560 miles
#### 560

The mom dog eats 1.5 cups of food * 3 = <<1.5*3=4.5>>4.5 cups per day.
For 6 days the mom dog will need 6 * 4.5 cups = <<6*4.5=27>>27 cups of food.
The puppies eat 1/2 cup of food * 2 = <<1/2*2=1>>1 cup per day.
There are 5 puppies * 1 cup = <<5*1=5>>5 cups per day for the puppies.
For the 6 days, the puppies will need 5 cups * 6 = <<5*6=30>>30 cups of food.

First figure out how much water beans take by multiplying the water use for corn by 2: 20 gallons/acre * 2 = <<20*2=40>>40 gallons/acre
Next, calculate Bob's water use by multiplying each plant's water use per acre by the number of acres he planted, then adding up the total water use for all three crops: 3 * 20 + 9 * 80 + 12 * 40 = <<3*20+9*80+12*40=1260>>1260
Now do the same thing for Brenda: 6 * 20 + 7 * 80 + 14 * 40 = <<6*20+7*80+14*40=1240>>1240
And do the same thing for Bernie: 2 * 20 + 12 * 80 = 1000
Now add up each farmer's water use to find the total water use: 1260 + 1240 + 1000 = <<1260+1240+1000=3500>>3500
Now divide Bob's water use by the total water use and multiply by 100 to find what percentage of the water he used: 1260 / 3500 * 100 = <<1260/3500*100=36>>36%

Let X be the number of adults attending the concert. The number of children attending the concert is 3*X.
The theater collected a total of 7*X + 3*(3*X) = $6,000.
Multiplying through the parentheses we get 7X + 9X = $6,000
Adding like terms we get 16X = $6,000
Dividing both sides by 16 we get X = 375, the number of adults attending the concert
The number of children attending the concert is triple this number: 375 adults * 3 children/adult = <<375*3=1125>>1125 children.
The number of people attending the concert is 375 + 1125 = <<375+1125=1500>>1500 people.
