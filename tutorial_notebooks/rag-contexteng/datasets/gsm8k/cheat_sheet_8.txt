On the fifth row, he used 3 - 2 = <<3-2=1>>1 block.
Therefore, he used a total of 9 + 7 + 5 + 3 + 1 = <<9+7+5+3+1=25>>25 blocks.
#### 25

If three-quarters of the boxes are full, then 1 – ¾ = ¼ of the boxes are half-full.
On average, each harvest therefore has 20 boxes * 0.25 = <<20*0.25=5>>5 boxes that are half-full.
This leaves 20 total boxes – 5 half-full boxes = <<20-5=15>>15 full boxes.
Half-full boxes hold 20 parsnips / 2 = <<20/2=10>>10 parsnips each.
In total, the half-full boxes, therefore, hold 5 boxes * 10 parsnips = <<5*10=50>>50 parsnips.
The full boxes hold a total of 15 boxes * 20 parsnips = <<15*20=300>>300 parsnips.
So Betty harvests a total of 50 + 300 = <<50+300=350>>350 parsnips in an average harvest.

The five numbers add up to 10, so the first three numbers add up to 10 - 8 = <<10-8=2>>2.
The third number is 0, so the first two numbers add up to 2 - 0 = <<2-0=2>>2.
The first and second numbers are equal, so they are both 2 / 2 = <<2/2=1>>1.
The fourth number is double the first number, so it is 2 * 1 = <<1*2=2>>2.
The fifth number is 8 - 2 = <<8-2=6>>6.
Thus, Brad’s zip code is 11026.
#### 11026

Initially, there were 6 boxes * 4 washing machines per box = <<6*4=24>>24 washing machines in each crate.
So there were 24 washing machines per crate * 10 crates = <<24*10=240>>240 washing machines in the shipping container.
A worker removes 1 washing machine from each box so there are now 4 original washing machines - 1 removed washing machine = <<4-1=3>>3 washing machines in each box.
This means there are 6 boxes * 3 washing machines per box = <<6*3=18>>18 washing machines in each crate.
So there are now 18 washing machines per crate * 10 crates = <<18*10=180>>180 washing machines in the shipping container.
The difference is how many machine washing machines were removed which is 240 initial washing machines – 180 current washing machines = <<240-180=60>>60 washing machines.

First figure out how many city miles Carl will drive round trip by multiplying the one-way number of city miles by 2: 60 miles * 2 = <<60*2=120>>120 miles
Then figure out how many highway miles Carl will drive round trip by multiplying the one-way number of highway miles by 2: 200 miles * 2 = <<200*2=400>>400 miles
Now divide the round-trip number of city miles by the number of city miles per gallon Carl's car gets: 120 miles / 30 mpg = <<120/30=4>>4 gallons
Now divide the round-trip number of highway miles by the number of highway miles per gallon Carl's car gets: 400 miles / 40 mpg = <<400/40=10>>10 gallons
Now add the gallons for the highway miles and the city miles to find the total number of gallons Carl needs to buy: 10 gallons + 4 gallons = <<10+4=14>>14 gallons
Finally, multiply the number of gallons Carl needs to buy by the cost per gallon to find out how much he spends: 14 gallons * $3.00 = $<<14*3=42.00>>42.00

We know that the time that Anna spends traveling is 20 minutes less than Jenny's travel time: a = j - 20
We also know that the distance both people travel is equal, so their speeds times their travel times must be equal: 15j = 45a
Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 15j = 45(j - 20)
Multiplying through the parentheses we get 15 j = 45j - 900
Subtracting 45 j from both sides, we get -30j = -900
Dividing both sides by -30, we get j = 30
Since Anna travels 20 minutes less than Jenny, she traveled 30 minutes - 20 minutes = <<20-10=10>>10 minutes

Let "x" be the age of Markus's grandson.
If Markus's son is twice the age of Markus's grandson, then Markus's son is 2*x.
If Markus is twice the age of his son, then Markus is 2*2*x.
Therefore, if the sum of the ages of Markus, his son, and his grandson is 140 years, then x+(2*x)+(2*2*x)=140 years.
Simplifying the equation, we see that 7*x=140 years.
Therefore, the age of Markus's grandson is x=20 years old.

#### 70

If they won 40 games in the first competition, they won 5/8*40 = <<5/8*40=25>>25 games in their second season.
In the third competition, they won games equal to the sum of the games they won in the last two competitions, which is 25+40 = <<25+40=65>>65 games.
Since the total number of games they won in the first two competitions is 65, and they won 65 more in the third competition, they won a total of 65+65 = <<65+65=130>>130 in all competitions.
#### 130

In the morning she runs 7 * 365 = <<7*365=2555>>2555 metres
In the afternoon she runs 3 * 365= <<3*365=1095>>1095 meters.
In one day, afternoon and morning, she runs 2555 + 1095 = <<2555+1095=3650>>3650 meters
In a week, she runs 7 * 3650= <<7*3650=25550>>25550 meters
#### 25550

Let L be the number of losses.
The number of wins is L + <<+8=8>>8.
The team played (L+8) + L = 2L + 8 = 22 games.
So, 2L = 22 - 8 = 14
So L = 14/2 = <<14/2=7>>7 losses.
Therefore, the team won 22 – 7 = <<22-7=15>>15 games.
#### 15

Let x be the number of birds on the fence. We know that 10 + 2*x = 50.

First, the 144 acres of grass will be eaten according to the equation 5*2*T + 8*1*T = 144.
Solving this equation for T, we find 18*T = 144, or T = 8 months of food are covered by the animals grazing on the rancher's pasture.
This means the farmer must buy feed corn for the remaining 12 - 8 = <<12-8=4>>4 months.
Next, the rancher's 8 sheep will require 4/2 = 2 bags of feed corn each, or 8*2 = <<8*2=16>>16 bags of feed corn in total for the 4 month period.
The rancher's 5 cows will require 4/1 = 4 bags of feed corn each, or 5*4 = <<5*4=20>>20 bags of feed corn in total for the month.
Therefore, the rancher needs 16+20 = <<16+20=36>>36 bags of feed corn for all of his animals.
So, the rancher will need to spend 36*10 = $<<36*10=360>>360 per year on feed corn.
#### 360

Twice the number of pigs is 10 x 2 = <<10*2=20>>20.

They also have 17 + 6 = <<17+6=23>>23 goats.
So, they have a total of 10 + 17 + 23 = <<10+17+23=50>>50 animals on their farm.
#### 50

Alex traveled at 20 miles per hour for 4.5 hours, so 20 * 4.5 = <<20*4.5=90>>90 miles on flat ground.
He traveled 12 miles per hour uphill for 2.5 hours, so 12 * 2.5 = <<12*2.5=30>>30 miles uphill.
He traveled downhill 24 miles per hour for 1.5 hours = 24 * 1.5 = <<24*1.5=36>>36 miles downhill.
Before his tire punctured, he traveled 90 + 30 + 36 = <<90+30+36=156>>156 miles.
So as the next town is 164 miles from where he began, Alex had to walk for 164 - 156 = <<164-156=8>>8 miles.

#### 45

First, we need to find the amount Matt read both years to establish what Pete read, so to find Matt's first-year total we multiply 75 / 1.5 = <<75/1.5=50>>50 books the previous year.
Since Pete read twice as many books as Matt did in the first year, and Matt's first-year total is 50, this means Pete read 50*2=<<50*2=100>>100 books his first year.
Since Pete doubled the number of books he read the following year, this means Pete read 100*2=<<100*2=200>>200 books the following year.
We add the two years of Pete's reading together to find 200+100=<<200+100=300>>300 books read in total.

Half of the students are playing basketball, which means 20 / 2 = <<20/2=10>>10 students play basketball.
Two-fifths plays volleyball, which leaves us with 20 * 2/5 = <<20*2/5=8>>8 students.
One-tenth play both games, which means 20 * 1/10 = <<20*1/10=2>>2 students.
There are 10 + 8 = <<10+8=18>>18 students who play basketball or volleyball.
Among these 18 students, 2 of them are playing both games, so that means 18 - 2 = <<18-2=16>>16 students play only one of the two games.
So finally, 20 - 16 = <<20-16=4>>4 students do not play either game.

First figure out how much Nancy has to pay after her parents pay their half by dividing the tuition by 2: $22,000 / 2 = $<<22000/2=11000>>11,000.
Then figure out how much Nancy's student loan is by multiplying her scholarship amount by 2: $3,000 * 2 = $<<3000*2=6000>>6,000.
Now subtract the amounts of Nancy's scholarship and loan to find out how much tuition she has to pay by working: $11,000 - $3,000 - $6,000 = $<<11000-3000-6000=2000>>2,000.
Now divide the remaining unpaid tuition by the number of hours Nancy works to find out how much she needs to make per hour: $2,000 / 200 hours = $<<2000/200=10>>10/hour.

First, we need to determine the overall number of portions. To do this, we begin by performing 20*2= <<20*2=40>>40 portions after the first halving.
Next, we take this portion number and double it again, performing 40*2=<<40*2=80>>80 portions after the second halving.
Lastly, we divide this portion number by the number of portions each person will be served, performing 80/8=<<80/8=10>>10 people served.
#### 10

10% + 50% = 60% of the chips in the jar are not green.
So, 100% - 60% = 40% of the chips are green.
There are 40%/10% = 4 sets of 10% to make 40%.
Hence, there are 3 chips x 4 sets = <<3*4=12>>12 green chips.
#### 12

If Marvin solved 40 math problems yesterday, he has solved 40*3 = <<40*3=120>>120 math problems today.
The total number of math problems that Marvin has practiced is 120+40 = <<120+40=160>>160
Arvin has practiced twice as many as Marvin, so has practiced 160 * 2 = <<160*2=320>>320 problems.
Together, Marvin and Arvin have solved 320+160 = <<320+160=480>>480 math problems.
#### 480

On the first day, the spaceship spent a total of 10 hours + 10 hours = <<10+10=20>>20 hours traveling.
On the first day, the spaceship spent a total of 3 hours + 1 hour = <<3+1=4>>4 hours not moving.
This is a total of 20 hours traveling + 4 hours not moving = <<20+4=24>>24 hours or 1 day.
So the rest of the journey took place over 3 days journey – 1 first day = <<3-1=2>>2 days.
This is the same as 2 days * 24 hours = <<2*24=48>>48 hours.
In these 2 days, the spaceship’s time is split into 11 hours traveling + 1 hour break = <<11+1=12>>12 hour blocks.
So in the last 2 days, the spaceship wasn't moving for a total of 48 hours / 12 hour blocks = <<48/12=4>>4 hours.
Adding this to breaks from the first day shows that the spaceship was not moving for a total of 4 + 4 = <<4+4=8>>8 hours.

The sum of the weights of the three adults is 140 x 3 = <<140*3=420>>420 pounds.
The sum of the weight of the two children is 64 x 2 = <<64*2=128>>128 pounds.
So the total weight of the 5 people who are in the elevator is 420 + 128 = <<420+128=548>>548 pounds.
This would mean that the next person's weight must not exceed 600 - 548 = <<600-548=52>>52 pounds.

First find the area of the first wall: 5 feet * 8 feet = <<5*8=40>>40 square feet
Then find the area of the second wall: 7 feet * 8 feet = <<7*8=56>>56 square feet
Then add the areas of the two walls to find the total area: 40 square feet + 56 square feet = <<40+56=96>>96 square feet
Then divide the number of square feet by the number of tiles per square foot to find the total number of tiles needed: 96 square feet * 4 tiles/square foot = <<96*4=384>>384 tiles
Then find the difference in cost per tile: $13/tile - $11/tile = $<<13-11=2>>2/tile
Then multiply the number of tiles by the cost difference per tile to find the total cost difference: $2/tile * 384 tiles = $<<2*384=768>>768
#### 768

First find the total amount of caffeine Brandy already drank: 120 mg/drink * 4 drinks = <<120*4=480>>480 mg

#### 20

Lisa spends $40 on t-shirts / 2 = $<<40/2=20>>20 on jeans.
She also spends $40 on t-shirts * 2 = $<<40*2=80>>80 on coats.
So Lisa has spent a total of 40 + 20 + 80 = $<<40+20+80=140>>140.
Carly spends $40 / 4 = $<<40/4=10>>10 on t-shirts.
She also spends $20 per pair of jeans * 3 = $<<20*3=60>>60 on jeans.
She then also spends $80 Lisa’s cost for coats / 4 = $<<80/4=20>>20 on coats.
So Carly has spent a total of 10 + 60 + 20 = $<<10+60+20=90>>90.
Lisa and Carly have therefore spent a total of 140 + 90 = $<<140+90=230>>230.

Kaydence's brother is half the father's age, which is 1/2*60 =<<1/2*60=30>>30 years.
The total age of Kaydence's father, mother, and brother is 30+118= <<30+118=148>>148 years.
If you add Kaydence's sister's age to the total age of the father, mother, and brother, you get 148+40 = <<148+40=188>>188 years.
If everyone's age in the family is 200, then Kaydence's age is 200-188 = <<200-188=12>>12 years old.

Substituting the second equation into the first equation, we get d + 7d - 3 = 45
Combining like terms, we get 8d - 3 = 45
Adding 4 to both sides, we get 8d = 48
Dividing both sides by 8, we get d = 6

The chest of drawers sold for half as much as the treadmill, for a price of $100/2= $<<100/2=50>>50.
The television sold for three times what he earned for the treadmill, for a price of $100*3= $<<100*3=300>>300.
For the three items, he raised $100+$50+$300 = $<<100+50+300=450>>450.
If $450 is 75% of the total sum of money that Toby made at the garage sale, then the total amount is $450 / (75/100) = $600.
#### 600

The total cost of pizza, soda and jeans is $2.75 + $1.50 + $11.50 = $<<2.75+1.5+11.5=15.75>>15.75
He now has $40 - $15.75 = $<<40-15.75=24.25>>24.25 left.
There are 4 quarters in $1.00 so $24 is equal to 24 x 4 = <<24*4=96>>96 quarters.
25 cents is equal to 1 quarter.
Therefore, Phil has 96 quarters + 1 quarter = <<96+1=97>>97 quarters now.
#### 97

If the bracelets he sold at $5 made $60, he sold $60/$5 = <<60/5=12>>12 bracelets.
If the total number of $5 bracelets was 12, then the total number of bracelets he sold was 30-12 =18
If he was selling a pair of bracelets at $8, he sold 18/2 = 9 pairs.
The total amount of money he made from selling the nine pairs is $8 * 9 = $<<8*9=72>>72
His total earnings from selling all of his bracelets are $72 + $60 = $<<72+60=132>>132

In total 500 + 500 = <<500+500=1000>>1000 people visited the park in a week
So it earned 1000 * 3 = <<1000*3=3000>>3000 dollars in a week
#### 3000

Let x be the score that William needs to achieve.
Since there are 30 people in the class, there are 30 - 1 = <<30-1=29>>29 people without him.
Since their average was a 74%, this means that (29 * 74 + x) / 30 >= 75.
Thus, 29 * 74 + x >= 30 * 75
Thus, 29 * 74 + x >= 2250
Thus, 2146 + x >= 2250
Thus, x >= 2250 - 2146
Thus, x >= 94
#### 94

100+100+100+80=<<100+100+100+80=380>>380 total score across 4 tests

Let R be the number of water bottles Daniel refilled for the rugby team.
Daniel filled 11 * 6 = <<11*6=66>>66 bottles for the football team.
He filled 66 + 12 = <<66+12=78>>78 bottles for the lacrosse team.
He got water bottles for four teams, so the team coaches wanted 2 * 4 = <<2*4=8>>8 bottles.
In all, he filled 66 + 53 + 78 + 8 + R = R + 205 = 254 bottles in all.
Thus, he filled R = 254 - 205 = <<254-205=49>>49 bottles for the rugby team this season.
#### 49

There are 800 x 5/8 = <<800*5/8=500>>500 girls.

There are 500 x 7/10 = <<500*7/10=350>>350 girls that are in the primary grades.
Hence, 500 - 350 = <<500-350=150>>150 girls are middle schoolers.
There are 300 x 2/5 = <<300*2/5=120>>120 boys that are in the primary grades.
Hence, 300 - 120 = <<300-120=180>>180 boy students are middle schoolers.
Therefore, a total of 150 girls + 180 boys = <<150+180=330>>330 middle schoolers.

#### 450

Let b be Bill's years of experience and j be Joan's years of experience. We know that j - 5 = 3(b - 5) and j = 2b.
Substituting the second equation into the first equation, we get 2b - 5 = 3(b - 5)
Multiplying through the parentheses, we get 2b - 5 = 3b - 15
Adding 15 to both sides, we get 2b + 10 = 3b
Subtracting 2b from both sides, we get 10 = b

The total percentage of money that Reese spent in February and March is 20% + 40% = 60%.
This means the April expenses and the money left in her account make up 100% - 60% = 40% of her savings.
Reese had $2900 + $1500 = $<<2900+1500=4400>>4400 for the April expenses and the money left in her account.
So, $4400 is equal to 40% which means every 1% is equal to $4400/40 = $<<4400/40=110>>110.
Therefore, Reese originally had $110 x 100 = $<<110*100=11000>>11000 in her savings account.

First figure out how many ounces of fruit fit in three bags by multiplying the number of bags by the number of ounces per bag: 49 oz/bag * 3 bags = <<49*3=147>>147 oz
Since Marta wants the same number of apples and oranges in each bag, we know the fruits always come in pairs. Find the weight of each pair of fruit by adding the weight of one apple to the weight of one orange: 3 oz + 4 oz = <<3+4=7>>7oz
Now figure out how many pairs of fruit Marta needs to fill the bags by dividing the total weight in the bags by the weight of each pair of fruit: 147 oz / 7 oz = <<147/7=21>>21
Now multiply the number of apples Marta needs to buy (21) by the weight per apple (4 oz) to find how many ounces she should buy: 21 * 4 oz = <<21*4=84>>84 oz

One hundred twenty minutes is equal to 120/60 = <<120/60=2>>2 hours.
Thus, the movie theater operates for 9 + 2 = <<9+2=11>>11 hours each day.
#### 11

Let B be the number of bandages the nurses’ station started with.
On the first day, they used 38 bandages and ordered 50, so they had B - 38 + 50 = B + 12 bandages left.
On the second day, they used 38 - 10 = <<38-10=28>>28 bandages.
Thus, at the end of the second day, they had B + 12 - 28 = B - 16 bandages left.
On the third day, they ordered 100 bandages and used half a pack, so they used 50 / 2 = 25.
Thus, on the third day, they had B - 16 + 100 - 25 = B + 59 bandages left.
At the end of the third day, they had 78 = B + 59 bandages left.
Thus, on the first day, they started with B = 78 - 59 = <<19=19>>19 bandages.
#### 19

Nora has saved 5*6 = <<5*6=30>>30 dollars
This means that Tamara has saved 30/3 = <<30/3=10>>10 dollars

Jill worked 2 hours + 1 hour for a total of 3 hours.
Jill worked 3 hours at $10/hour so she made 3*$10 = $<<3*10=30>>30
John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday so 2*2 = <<2*2=4>>4 hours
John worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday so 3*1 = <<3*1=3>>3 hours
John worked 4 hours + 3 hours for 7 hours
John worked 7 hours at $10/hour so he made 7*10 = $<<7*10=70>>70
John made $70 while Jill made $30 so $70 - $30 = $<<70-30=40>>40 more dollars

#### 13

First, we need to determine how many miles Tony drives in 4 weeks. We do this by performing 50*5=<<50*5=250>>250 miles per week.
Next, we multiply the weekly total by 4 by performing 4*250= <<4*250=1000>>1000 miles in 4 weeks.
Now, we need to find out how many times Tony needs to fill up his gas tank. His gas tank holds enough gas to last 25*10=<<25*10=250>>250 miles.
This means in 4 weeks, he needs to fill up his tank 1000/250= <<1000/250=4>>4 times.
Since Tony's gas tank holds 10 gallons, this means he needs to pay for 4*10- 40 gallons of gas in a month.
Since gas costs $2 a gallon, this means Tony spends 40*2=$<<40*2=80>>80 on gas every month,
