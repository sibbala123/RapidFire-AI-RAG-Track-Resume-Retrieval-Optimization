Four $10 bills have a value of 4*$10 =$<<4*10=40>>40
The six $20 bills also are worth 6*$20 = $<<6*20=120>>120
Ali has $40+$120 = $<<40+120=160>>160
When he gives his sister half of the money, he remains with the other half, which totals 1/2*$160 = $<<1/2*160=80>>80
He then spends 3/5*$80 = $<<3/5*80=48>>48 on dinner.
The total amount of money that Ali has now is $80-$48 = $<<80-48=32>>32
#### 32

Since the train takes 2 hours longer to go an equal distance as the car, to reach station B, the train took 4.5+2 = 6.5 hours.
Together, the train and the car take a total of 6.5+4.5 = <<6.5+4.5=11>>11 hours to travel from station A to station B.
#### 11

1 hour is 60 minutes, so 120 minutes is 120 / 60 = <<120/60=2>>2 hours.
During one hour a fox can make 50 kilometers, so during two hours, he would be able to run 50 * 2 = <<50*2=100>>100 kilometers.
#### 100

Samantha, Aira, and Joe have 6 x 3 = <<6*3=18>>18 rubber bands altogether.
If we let x be the number of bands that Aira had, then Samantha had x + 5.
Since Aira had 1 fewer band than Joe, then Joe had x + 1.
Since the total number of bands is 18, then the equation is x + (x + 5) + (x + 1) = 18.
By simplifying the left side of the equation, we have 3x + 6 = <<3*+6=18>>18.
Putting all the constant terms on the right side gives 3x = 12.
So the value of x is 12/3 = 4. Hence, Aira had 4 rubber bands.

They ordered 3 dozen oysters at $15.00 a dozen so that's 3*15 = $<<3*15=45.00>>45.00
They ordered 2 pounds of shrimp for $14.00 a pound so that's 2*14 = $<<2*14=28.00>>28.00
They ordered 2 pounds of fried clams for $13.50 a pound so that's 2*13.50 = $<<2*13.50=27.00>>27.00
All total their bill comes to 45+28+27 = $<<45+28+27=100.00>>100.00
Their bill was $100.00 and they are splitting it equally amongst 4 people so they each owe 100/4 = $<<100/4=25.00>>25.00
#### 25

If each shelf has 400 books, then the four shelves have 4*400 = 1600 books.
Since the total number of books on the shelves is the same as the distance that Karen bikes back home, biking to and from the library takes 1600+1600 = <<1600+1600=3200>>3200 miles
#### 3200

Let X be Frank's age.
So Gabriel is X-3 years old.
The total of their ages is X + (X-3) = 17 years old.
2X-3 = 17
2X = 20
X = <<10=10>>10
So Frank is X = <<10=10>>10 years old.
#### 10

If Kelly weighs 15% less than Megan, this means Kelly's weight is 100 - 15 = <<100-15=85>>85% of Megan's weight.
85% is 0.85, so Megan weighs 34 / 0.85 = <<34/0.85=40>>40 kilograms.
Mike weighs 5 kilograms more than Megan, so he weighs 40 + 5 = <<40+5=45>>45 kilograms.
In total all three kids weigh 34 + 40 + 45 = <<34+40+45=119>>119 kilograms.
That means to cross the bridge safely, they weigh 119 - 100 = <<119-100=19>>19 kilograms too much.
#### 19

Trish walks 1 mile on the first day, and since she walks double the previous day's amount each day that means she walks 1*2=<<1*2=2>>2 miles the second day.
On the following day, she walks double the distance of the previous day's total of 2 miles, meaning she walks 2*2=<<2*2=4>>4 miles that day.
On the following day, she walks double the distance of the previous day's total of 4 miles, meaning she walks 4*2=<<4*2=8>>8 miles that day.
On the following day, she walks double the distance of the previous day's total of 8 miles, meaning she walks 8*2=<<8*2=16>>16 miles that day.
As we're looking for the first day that her distance exceeds 10 times her original total, that means we're seeking a mile total of greater than or equal to 10*1= <<10*1=10>>10 miles,
Since she accomplished this on the 5th day of walking, the answer is <<5=5>>5.
#### 5

He buys 20*60=<<20*60=1200>>1200 minutes of music a month

Since Adele has 30 albums, and Bridget has 15 fewer, Bridget has 30-15= <<30-15=15>>15 albums.
Together, Bridget and Adele has 30+15 = <<30+15=45>>45 albums.
Katrina has six times the number of albums as Bridget, a total of 15*6= <<6*15=90>>90 albums.
Adele, Bridget, and Katrina have a total of 90+45 = <<90+45=135>>135 albums together.
Miriam has five times the number of albums as Katrina, a total of 5*90 = <<5*90=450>>450 albums.
Together, Adele, Bridget, Katrina, and Miriam have 135+450 = <<135+450=585>>585 albums.
#### 585

Her children ate 25% of the 16 brownies so they ate .25*16 = <<25*.01*16=4>>4 slices
There were 16 brownies and the children ate 4 slices, leaving 16-4 = <<16-4=12>>12 brownies
The family ate 50% of the remaining 12 brownies so they ate .50*12 = <<50*.01*12=6>>6 brownies
There were 12 brownies and they ate 6 which leaves 12-6 = <<12-6=6>>6 brownies
Lorraine had 1 more of the 6 remaining brownies which leaves 6-1 = <<6-1=5>>5 brownies

Let S be the number of people on the first hundred years’ ship.
The second hundred years’ ship had twice as many as the first, so it had 2S people.
The third hundred years’ ship had twice as many as the second, so it had 2 * 2S = <<2*2=4>>4S people.
All the ships had S + 2S + 4S = 7S = 847 people.
Thus, the ship that the monster ate in the first hundred years had S = 847 / 7 = <<847/7=121>>121 people on it.
#### 121

Alexander has sent pictures to a total of 1 original gallery + 5 new galleries = <<1+5=6>>6 galleries.
For signatures, he has used a total of 6 galleries * 2 pencils per gallery = <<6*2=12>>12 pencils.
So of the pencils that he used, 88 total pencils – 12 signature pencils = <<88-12=76>>76 pencils for drawings.
At the first gallery, he used 9 pictures * 4 pencils per picture = <<9*4=36>>36 pencils.
So in the new galleries, he used 76 total pencils for drawings – 36 pencils at the first gallery = <<76-36=40>>40 pencils.
The new galleries received a total of 40 pencils / 4 pencils per picture = <<40/4=10>>10 pictures.
As the new galleries all receive equal amounts of pictures, each gallery must have 10 pictures / 5 galleries = <<10/5=2>>2 pictures per gallery.

First find how much the rail project will increase the house value by multiplying the initial value by 25%: $400,000 * .25 = $<<400000*.25=100000>>100,000
Then add that amount to the initial value to find the new value: $100,000 + $400,000 = $<<100000+400000=500000>>500,000
Then divide the maximum amount of property tax Jenny can afford to pay by the property tax rate to find the maximum value her house can have: $15,000 / .02 = $<<15000/.02=750000>>750,000
Now subtract the house's value after the rail project from the maximum value to find how much value the improvements can have: $750,000 - $500,000 = $<<750000-500000=250000>>250,000

Each free throw counts as 1 point, so 5 successful free throws means she scores 5*1= <<5*1=5>>5 points
Each 3 pointer counts as 3 points, so this means Liz scores 3*3= <<3*3=9>>9 points from 3 pointers
Each jump shot counts as 2 points, meaning Liz scores 4*2=<<4*2=8>>8 points of jump shots.
Liz's opponents score 10 points during the quarter, meaning their lead is 30 points in total before accounting for Liz's scoring.
Liz scores a total of 5+9+8=<<5+9+8=22>>22 points in the quarter.
This amount is subtracted from the lead of Liz's opponents, meaning they win by 30-22= <<30-22=8>>8 points.

If half of the people in Nantucket are going to the planned meeting, then there are 1/2*300 = <<300*1/2=150>>150 people going to the meeting.
If the number of males going to the meeting is twice the number of females, we'll assume the number of females is x and the number of males is 2x.
We know that x+2x=150
Adding like terms produces 3x=150
After dividing both sides by 3, we have x = 150/3 = <<150/3=50>>50
The number of females attending the meeting is x = <<50=50>>50

Rick starts with 400 books and divides them into two categories of equal size, meaning there are two categories of 400/2= <<400/2=200>>200 books.
Rick repeats this process again, dividing the 200 book categories into equal halves, leaving him with 200/2=<<200/2=100>>100 books in each.
Rick repeats this process again, dividing the 100 book categories into equal halves, leaving him with 100/2=<<100/2=50>>50 books in each.
Rick repeats this process again, dividing the 50 book categories into equal halves, leaving him with 50/2=<<50/2=25>>25 books in each.
Since Rick is looking for categories with 25 books in each, he accomplishes this by the 4th step.
#### 4

He needs 500 * 12 = <<500*12=6000>>6000 square feet
This means it cost $5 * 6000 = $30,000
That means construction comes to $30000 * 2 = $<<30000*2=60000>>60,000
So the total cost is $60000 + $30000 = $<<60000+30000=90000>>90,000
His partner covers $90,000 * .4 = $<<90000*.4=36000>>36,000
So he has to pay $90,000 - $36,000 = $<<90000-36000=54000>>54,000

The store made a $50 x 30/100 = $<<50*30/100=15>>15 profit for selling it 30% above the cost.
So, the book was sold for $50 + $15 = $<<50+15=65>>65.
During a sale, the book’s selling price decreased by $65 x 10/100 = $<<65*10/100=6.50>>6.50.
So, the book was sold for $65 - $6.50 = $<<65-6.5=58.50>>58.50.
There was $58.50 - $50 = $<<58.5-50=8.50>>8.50 profit after the discount.
Therefore, the percent profit is $8.50/$50 x 100% = <<8.5/50*100=17>>17%.

The total bill before taxes or gratuities was $80 for the steak + $10 for the wine = $80+$10 = $<<80+10=90>>90
If the tax is 10%, then the taxes paid were $90 * 10% = $<<90*10*.01=9>>9
That means that the total bill before gratuities was $90 + $9 = $<<90+9=99>>99
If the final bill was $140, then you were charged $140-$99 = $<<140-99=41>>41 for gratuities

Let her previous monthly income be p
The cost of her rent and utilities was 40% of p which is (40/100)*p = 2p/5
Her income was increased by $600 so it is now p+$600
The cost of her rent and utilities now amount to 25% of (p+$600) which is (25/100)*(p+$600) = (p+$600)/4
Equating both expressions for cost of rent and utilities: 2p/5 = (p+$600)/4
Multiplying both sides of the equation by 20 gives 8p = 5p+$3000
Subtracting 5p from both sides gives: 3p = $3000
Dividing both sides by 3 gives p = $1000

Let L represent the lowest level of financial backing.
Thus, the second level is 10L and the highest level is 10 * 10L = 100L.
The entrepreneur got 2 highest level backers, 3 second level backers, and 10 lowest level backers, so 2 * 100L + 3 * 10L + 10L = 200L + 30L + 10L = 240L = $12000.
Therefore, the lowest level of financial backing was L = 12000 / 240 = $<<12000/240=50>>50.
Thus, the highest level of financial backing was 10 * 10 * 50 = $<<10*10*50=5000>>5000.

After 1 year Jim has gained $80 * 0.15 = $<<80*0.15=12>>12
Therefore, after 1 year his portfolio has grown to $80 + $12 = $<<80+12=92>>92
He then adds $28 to this total, so his new portfolio total is $92 + $28 = $<<92+28=120>>120 at the beginning of year 2
Next, this total grows by 10%, so he gains $120 * 0.10 = $<<120*0.10=12>>12 across year 2
Thus, after year 2, his portfolio is worth $120 + $12 = $<<120+12=132>>132

He treats 20*.2=<<20*.2=4>>4 extra patients
So he treats 20+4=<<20+4=24>>24 patients at the second hospital
So he treats 20+24=<<20+24=44>>44 patients a day
That means he treats 44*5=<<44*5=220>>220 patients a week
So he treats 220*50=<<220*50=11000>>11,000 patients a year
#### 11000

If x is Maria's age, then Mario's age is x + 1.
The equation that represents the sum of their ages is x + x + 1 = 7.
By combining like terms, the equation becomes 2x = 6.
Hence, the value of x which represents the age of Maria is 6/2=<<6/2=3>>3.
So Mariu is 3 + 1 = <<3+1=4>>4 years old.

There are 4 quarters in a dollar so in quarters, each machine holds 80 quarters / 4 = $<<80/4=20>>20.
There are 10 dimes in a dollar so in dimes, each machine holds 100 dimes / 10 = $10.
Each machine therefore holds $20 in quarters + $10 in dimes = $<<20+10=30>>30.
So Erin must therefore have $90 total income / $30 income per machine = <<90/30=3>>3 machines.

So he makes 156*25=$<<156*25=3900>>3900 a day
The store is open 7-3=<<7-3=4>>4 days a week
So in a week, he makes 3900*4=$<<3900*4=15600>>15,600
#### 15600

Let's assume the total amount of money that Jane has is m.
Since Jean has 3 times as much money as Jane, he has 3*m=3m
Combined, Jean and Jane have a total of m+3m = $76
This evaluates to 4m=$76
The total amount of money that Jane has, represented by m, is m=$76/4
Jane has m=$<<19=19>>19
Since Jean has three times as much money as Jane, Jean has 3*$19=$57
#### 57

The major characters each get 15000*3=$<<15000*3=45000>>45,000
So he pays the main characters 45,000*5=$<<45000*5=225000>>225,000
So in total he pays 225,000+60,000=$<<225000+60000=285000>>285,000
#### 285,000

First find the area of the courtyard: 10 feet * 25 feet = <<10*25=250>>250 feet
Then multiply the area by the number of tiles per square foot to find the total number of tiles needed: 250 feet * 4 tiles/square foot = <<250*4=1000>>1000 tiles
Then multiply the number of tiles by the percentage that are green to find the total number of green tiles: 1000 tiles * 40% = <<1000*40*.01=400>>400 tiles
Subtract that number from the total number of tiles to find the number of red tiles: 1000 tiles - 400 tiles = <<1000-400=600>>600 tiles
Multiply the number of red tiles by the price per red tile to find the cost of the red tiles: 600 tiles * $1.50/tile = $<<600*1.5=900>>900
Multiply the number of green tiles by the price per green tile to find the cost of the green tiles: 400 tiles * $3.00/tile = $<<400*3=1200>>1200
Then add the cost of each type of tile to find the total cost: $900 + $1200 = $<<900+1200=2100>>2100

Betsy still has 32-8 = <<32-8=24>>24 more squares to sew together
#### 24

Let X mark the number of holes they dug on the fourth day.
The island had 4 * 10 = <<4*10=40>>40 holes when they found the treasure.
They dug 10 + 13 + 8 = <<10+13+8=31>>31 holes the first three days.
After filling in 2 holes, they had 31 - 2 = <<31-2=29>>29 holes dug.
When they found the treasure, they had 29 + X = 40 holes dug.
Thus, the pirates dug 40 - 29 = <<40-29=11>>11 holes on the fourth day.

If he left his home at 7:50 a.m. and the distance to the pick-up point is 30 minutes away, he arrived at the pick-up point at 7:50 + 30 minutes = 8:20 a.m.
If the bus leaves at 8:00 a.m. every day, then Delaney was 8:20 a.m. - 8:00 a.m. = <<820-800=20>>20 minutes late when the bus had already left.
#### 20

Pauline planted in total 3 * 5 = <<3*5=15>>15 tomatoes.
Pauline also planted 5 * 4 = <<5*4=20>>20 cucumbers.
In total Pauline planted 15 + 20 + 30 = <<15+20+30=65>>65 different vegetables.
The whole garden can be filled up with 10 * 15 = <<10*15=150>>150 different vegetables.
So Pauline could plant 150 - 65 = <<150-65=85>>85 more vegetables in her garden.
#### 85

Let T be the number of toys Joel’s sister donated.
Joel donated twice as many toys, so he donated 2T toys.
Joel’s friends donated 18 + 42 + 2 + 13 = <<18+42+2+13=75>>75 toys.
In all, Joel collected T + 2T + 75 = 3T + 75 = 108 toys.
Joel and his sister donated 3T = 108 - 75 = 33 toys together.
Therefore, T = 33 / 3 = <<33/3=11>>11 toys were his sister’s.
Thus, 2T = 2 * 11 = <<2*11=22>>22 toys were Joel’s.
#### 22

After Smith gave him $200, Randy had 2000+1200=<<2000+1200=3200>>3200 dollars.

#### 114

First figure out how many total speeding tickets the two people got by adding the 6 speeding tickets Sarah got to the equal number (6) that Mark got: 6 + 6 = <<6+6=12>>12
Now subtract the combined number of speeding tickets from the total number of tickets to find the combined number of parking tickets: 24 - 12 = <<24-12=12>>12
Now express Mark's number of parking tickets in terms of the number of parking tickets Sarah got: m = <<2=2>>2s
We know that m + s = 12, so substitute in the value of m from the previous step to get 2s + s = 12
Combine like terms to get 3s = 12
Divide both sides of the equation to get s = <<4=4>>4
Now multiply the number of parking tickets Sarah got by 2 to find the number Mark got: 4 * 2 = <<4*2=8>>8
#### 8

The price $7500 is 100% - 25% = 75% of the original price.

At the end of 2018, the tree will grow 100 x 10/100 = <<100*10/100=10>>10 meters more.
Thus, its height at the end of 2018 is 100 + 10 = <<100+10=110>>110 meters.
At the end of 2019, the tree will grow 110 x 10/100 = <<110*10/100=11>>11 meters more.
So, its height at the end of 2019 is 110 + 11 = <<110+11=121>>121 meters.
Therefore, the tree has grown 121 - 100 = <<121-100=21>>21 meters.

First, find a common denominator for the fractions by multiplying 5 and 4: 5 * 4 = <<5*4=20>>20.
Then convert 1/5 to twentieths by multiplying the top and bottom by 4: 1/5 * 4/4 = 4/20.
Then convert 3/4 to twentieths by multiplying the top and bottom by 5: 3/4 * 5/5 = 15/20
Now that the two fractions have the same denominator, you can add them: 4/20 + 15/20 = 19/20.
Now divide 19 by 20 and multiply the answer by 100 to convert the fraction to a percentage: 19/20 * 100 = %<<19/20*100=95>>95.

Let G be the number of gummy worms in the bag when Carlos bought it.
On the first day, he ate half the gummy worms, so he had G / 2 gummy worms.
On the second day, he ate half of the remaining gummy worms, so he had G / 2 / 2 = G / 4 gummy worms.
On the third day, he ate another half, so he had G / 4 / 2 = G / 8 gummy worms.
On the fourth day, he ate another half and had 4 left, so he had G / 8 / 2 = G / 16 = 4 gummy worms.
Thus, there were G = 4 * 16 = <<4*16=64>>64 gummy worms in the bag when Carlos bought it.
