Let P be the number of pages in the first chapter.
The second chapter has P + 3 pages.
The third chapter has P + 3 + 3 = P + <<+3+3=6>>6 pages.
The fourth chapter has P + 6 + 3 = P + <<+6+3=9>>9 pages.
The fifth chapter has P + 9 + 3 = P + <<+9+3=12>>12 pages.
The whole book has P + 3 + P + 6 + P + 9 + P + 12 = 5P + 30 = 95 pages.
Thus, without the 30 extra pages from additional chapters, 5P = 95 - 30 = 65 pages.
Therefore, the first chapter had P = 65 / 5 = <<65/5=13>>13 pages.

If Liz needs only $4,000 to buy a new $30,000 car, that means she has $30,000-$4,000=$<<30000-4000=26000>>26,000 from the proceeds of selling her old car
If she sold her car at 80% of what she originally paid for and sold it for $26,000 then she originally paid $26,000/80% = $32,500 for her old car
If she paid $32,500 for her old car and the new one is $30,000 then, the new one is $32,500-$30,000 = $<<32500-30000=2500>>2,500 cheaper

First find the cost of the ticket and the entrée for each person: $50/person + $10/person = $<<50+10=60>>60/person
Then multiply that cost by the number of people to find the total cost of entrees and tickets: $60/person * 6 people = $<<60*6=360>>360
Now find how many people ordered drink tickets: 6 people / 2 = <<6/2=3>>3 people
Now find the total cost of the drink tickets: 3 people * $30/person = $<<3*30=90>>90
Now find the total cost of the evening: $90 + $360 = $<<90+360=450>>450
Now multiply this quantity by 90% to find the amount of the refund: $450 * .9 = $<<450*.9=405>>405
Now subtract the refund amount from the total cost to find how much money the friends lost: $450 - $405 = $<<450-405=45>>45

First find the number of pinecones eaten by reindeer: 20% * 2000 pinecones = <<20*.01*2000=400>>400 pine cones
Then find the total number of pinecones eaten by squirrels: 400 pine cones * 2 = <<400*2=800>>800 pine cones
Then subtract those two amounts to find the number of pinecones left: 2000 pinecones - 400 pine cones - 800 pine cones = <<2000-400-800=800>>800 pinecones
Divide that number by 4 to find the number that are collected for fires: 800 pinecones / 4 = <<800/4=200>>200 pine cones
Then subtract that number from the 800 pinecones to find the total left on the ground: 800 pine cones - 200 pinecones = <<800-200=600>>600 pine cones

Each raised bed is 8 feet long, the same as the planks, so the long sides of the beds will each be 1 plank long.
Each raised bed is 2 feet wide, or 2/8 = 1/4 the length of the planks, so the short sides will each be 1/4 plank long.
Each bed is 2 feet tall, and the planks are 1 foot wide, so each side will need 2 pieces of lumber of the same length.
So each bed will require 2 * 2 * 1.25 = 4 * 1.25 = <<2*2*1.25=5>>5 planks of wood.
Bob wants to build 10 raised beds, so he will need 10 * 5 = <<10*5=50>>50 planks of lumber.

Gary earned overtime, so he worked at least 40 hours. for which he was paid 40 hours * $12/hour = $<<40*12=480>>480 at his normal wage.
This means that $696 - $480 = $<<696-480=216>>216 was earned at his overtime wage.
His overtime wage is 1.5 his normal wage, or $12 * 1.5 = $<<12*1.5=18>>18 per hour.
So Gary worked $216 / $18 per hour = <<216/18=12>>12 hours' worth of overtime.
So in total, Gary worked 40 hours + 12 hours = <<40+12=52>>52 hours that week.

The blacksmith can create a total of 400kg iron / 2kg iron per horseshoe = <<400/2=200>>200 horseshoes.
The farms need enough horseshoes for 2 farms * 2 horses each = <<2*2=4>>4 horses.
The stables need enough horseshoes for 5 stables * 2 horses each = <<5*2=10>>10 horses.
So in total, the farms and stables have 4 + 10 = <<4+10=14>>14 horses that need horseshoes.
This is a total of 14 horses * 4 horseshoes per horse = <<14*4=56>>56 horseshoes.
This means the blacksmith has 200 total horseshoes – 56 horseshoes for the stables and farms = 144 horseshoes left for the riding school.
The riding school therefore will have enough horseshoes for 144 horseshoes / 4 horseshoes per horse = <<144/4=36>>36 horses.

The total cost of the first venue can be expressed as 200 + 5*X, where X is the number of guests. Similarly, the total cost of the second venue can be expressed as 25*X.
Next we must find the value of X that makes these two costs equal. Setting these two expressions equal to each other, we get the equation 200 + 5*X = 25*X.
By subtracting 5*X from each side to get 200 = 20*X.
Then, X = 200/20 = 10, so when there are 10 guests the two venues will be equal in cost.
#### 10

Let x = the number of marbles in the jar.
If 50% of the marbles are blue, and 25% of them are red, then the remaining 25% must be either green or yellow.

The total weight of the boxes is 100 boxes x 100 kg/box = 10 000 kg.
The total weight of the crates is 10 crates x 60 kg/crate = <<10*60=600>>600 kg.
The total weight of the sacks is 50 sacks x 50 kg/sack = 2 500 kg.
So, the total weight of the supplies that were already loaded is 10,000 kg+ 600 kg + 2500 kg = <<10000+600+2500=13100>>13,100 kg.
Hence, the most weight that can still be loaded in the truck is 13,500 kg - 13,100 kg = <<13500-13100=400>>400 kg.
This means 400 kg / 40 kg/bag = <<400/40=10>>10 bags can still be loaded in the truck.

First, if the a full tire needs 500 cubic inches of air, then two empty tires need: 500 cubic inches/tire * 2 tires = <<500*2=1000>>1000 cubic inches.
Accordingly, the 40%-full tire needs 500 cubic inches * (100%-40%).
So, we find the 40%-full tire needs 500 cubic inches * (60%) = <<500*(60*.01)=300>>300 cubic inches.
And, the 70%-full tire needs 500 cubic inches * (100%-70%).
So, the 70%-full tire needs 500 cubic inches * (30%)= <<500*(30*.01)=150>>150 cubic inches.
Now add up the needs of all the tires to find the total number of cubic inches needed: 1000 cubic inches + 300 cubic inches + 150 cubic inches = <<1000+300+150=1450>>1450 cubic inches.
Finally, if the pumps each hold 50 cubic inches, the total number of pumps needed is 1550 cubic inches / 50 cubic inches/pump = 29 pumps.

Let P be the number of pages of the first issue of the comic.
The second issue is the same number of pages, so the first and second issues are P + P = 2P pages.
The third issue is 4 pages longer, so it is P + 4 pages.
All three issues are 2P + P + 4 = 3P + 4 = 220 pages long.
Thus, 3P = 220 - 4 = 216 pages.
Therefore, the first issue of the comic was P = 216 / 3 = <<216/3=72>>72 pages.

Janice takes 30/2 = <<30/2=15>>15 minutes to clean her room.
It takes 30 + 5 = <<30+5=35>>35 minutes for her to walk the dog.
It takes her 30 x 1/6 = <<30*1/6=5>>5 minutes to take out the trash.
So, it will take 30 + 15 + 35 + 5 = <<30+15+35+5=85>>85 minutes to do all those chores.
Since there are 60 minutes in 1 hour, then 2 hours is 2 x 60 = <<2*60=120>>120 minutes.

If 1/5 of the total capacity of the hospital beds is occupied, it means 1/5 * 1000 = <<1000*1/5=200>>200 beds have patients using them.
The total number of beds in the hospital without new admissions is 1000 beds - 200 beds = <<1000-200=800>>800 beds.
If 50 people are admitted each day, the total number of patients in the hospital after one week is 50 patients/day * 7 days/week = 350 patients.
After two weeks, the total number of patients admitted into the hospital is 350 patients/week * 2 weeks = <<350*2=700>>700 patients, who each use one bed.
If there were 800 unoccupied beds in the hospital before the new admissions, the total number is reduced to 800 beds - 700 beds = <<800-700=100>>100 unoccupied beds.

Let s be the number of times the small bell rings, and b be the number of times the big bell rings. We know that s + b = 52 and s = 4 + 1/3b.
Substituting the second equation into the first equation, we get 4 + 1/3b + b = 52
Subtracting 4 from both sides, we get 1/3b + b = 48
Combining like terms, we get 4/3b = 48
Dividing both sides of the equation by 4/3, we get b = 36

If Devin is 12 years old, then Eden is 2 * 12 years = 24 years old.
Since Eden's mom two times older than Eden, her age is 24 years * 2 = <<24*2=48>>48 years.
In total, they have 48 years + 24 years + 12 years = <<48+24+12=84>>84 years
The average age for the three is 84 years / 3 people = <<84/3=28>>28 years/person

First find how long half Jake's dad's trip is: 30 minutes / 2 = <<30/2=15>>15 minutes
Then convert the minutes to hours: 15 minutes * 1 hour/60 minutes = .25 hours
Now find how far Jake's dad travels at 28 miles per hour: .25 hours * 28 miles per hour = <<.25*28=7>>7 miles
Then find how far Jake's dad travels at 60 miles per hour: .25 hours * 60 miles per hour = <<.25*60=15>>15 miles
Now add those distances to find the total distance to the water park: 7 miles + 15 miles = <<7+15=22>>22 miles
Now divide the total distance by Jake's speed to find how long it takes him: 22 miles / 11 miles/hour = <<22/11=2>>2 hours

First find the number of green marbles: 20 yellow marbles / 2 = <<20/2=10>>10 green marbles
Then find how many marbles are either red or blue: 60 marbles - 20 yellow marbles - 10 green marbles = <<60-20-10=30>>30 marbles
Divide this number in half to find how many marbles are blue: 30 marbles / 2 = <<30/2=15>>15 blue marbles
Finally, divide the number of blue marbles by the total number of marbles and multiply by 100 to find the percentage chance of getting a blue marble: 15 marbles / 60 marbles * 100 = <<15/60*100=25>>25%
#### 25

The number of students who like the color blue is 30/100*200 = <<30/100*200=60>>60
Out of the 200 students in the class, 200-60 = <<200-60=140>>140 don't like the color blue.
Among the students who don't like the color blue, 40/100*140 = <<40/100*140=56>>56 students like the color red.
If the rest of the students like neither blue nor red and only like the color yellow, their number is 140-56 = <<140-56=84>>84
The total number of students who like the color yellow and those who like the color blue is 84+60 = <<84+60=144>>144
#### 144

To find the beanstalk's height after one day, multiply the starting height by 2: 4 feet * 2 = <<4*2=8>>8 feet
To find its height after two days, multiply the height after one day by 2: 8 feet * 2 = <<8*2=16>>16 feet
To find its height after three days, multiply the height after two days by 2: 16 feet * 2 = <<16*2=32>>32 feet. This is taller than the window, so it took three days for the beanstalk to pass the window.

Hence, Ofelia got 35 - 21 = <<35-21=14>>14 incorrect answers.
Therefore, their team got 3 + 14 = <<3+14=17>>17 incorrect answers.
#### 17

Chris would earn 5200 - 5200 / 10 = 5200 - 520 = $<<5200-5200/10=4680>>4680 from the first buyer.
He would earn 5200 - 80 - 80 * 3 = 5200 - 80 * 4 = 5200 - 320 = $<<5200-80-80*3=4880>>4880 from the second buyer.
The difference between Chris’s earnings would be 4880 - 4680 = $<<4880-4680=200>>200.
#### 200

Marina = 4.5 pounds = 72 ounces

#### 21

The 3 cats consume 60 grams/cat x 3 cats = <<60*3=180>>180 grams of food per meal.
Since they eat twice a day, then they consume 180 grams/meal x 2 meals/day = <<180*2=360>>360 grams in a day.
So, 720 grams of cat food only last for 720 grams / 360 grams/day = <<720/360=2>>2 days.

Let’s set up an equation by calling the lifespan of a bat x, and therefore the lifespan of the hamster x – 6, and the lifespan of the frog 4 (x – 6) which add together to equal 30, like this: x + x – 6 + 4 (x – 6) = 30.
That gives us 6x – 30 = 30 and we should add 30 to each side to try to isolate the x.
Now we have 6x = 60, which we will divide by 6, 6x / 6 = 60 / 6.
This gives us x = <<10=10>>10. The bat has a lifespan of 10 years.

First find the total amount of fertilizer the horses produce per day: 5 gallons/horse * 80 horses = <<5*80=400>>400 gallons
Then multiply the number of acres of farmland by the number of gallons per acre to find the total amount of fertilizer needed: 400 gallons/acre * 20 acres = <<400*20=8000>>8000 gallons
Then divide the total amount of fertilizer needed by the amount of fertilizer produced per day to find the number of days needed to collect fertilizer: 8000 gallons / 400 gallons/day = <<8000/400=20>>20 days
Then divide the total number of acres Janet needs to cover by the number of acres she can cover per day to find how many days it takes her to cover them all: 20 acres / 4 acres/day = <<20/4=5>>5 days
Then add the time to collect the fertilizer to the time to spread it to find the total time: 5 days + 20 days = <<5+20=25>>25 days
#### 25

Betty has 30% more points than Adam, so it's 30/100 * 50 = <<30/100*50=15>>15 points more.
Betty's total is therefore 50 + 15 = <<50+15=65>>65 points.
Tom has 30 points less than Betty, so he has 65 - 30 = <<65-30=35>>35 points.
Marta has 3 times more points than Tom, so she has 3 * 35 = <<3*35=105>>105 points.
In total, all students collected 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = <<50+65+35+105=255>>255 points.
So the class is missing 400 - 255 = <<400-255=145>>145 points to go on the trip.
