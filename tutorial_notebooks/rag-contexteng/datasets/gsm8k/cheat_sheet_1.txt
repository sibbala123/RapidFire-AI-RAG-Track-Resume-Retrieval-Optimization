Let R be the total ore output of the company.
Of Big Dig’s output, 100 - 10 - 60 = <<100-10-60=30>>30% is nickel.
Since 720 is 60% of 100% of their output, 720 / R = 60 / 100.
Thus, Big Dig mines R = 100 * 720 / 60 = <<100*720/60=1200>>1200 tons of ore daily.
Therefore, Big Dig mines 1200 * 30 / 100 = <<1200*30/100=360>>360 tons of copper daily.
#### 360

Every second month Nina does twice the regular distance, which means 400 * 2 = <<400*2=800>>800 kilometers.
Two years is 24 months, so half of this time is 24 * 0.5 = <<24*0.5=12>>12 months.
So in 12 months Nina does 400 * 12 = <<400*12=4800>>4800 kilometers.
And in the other 12 months, she does 800 * 12 = <<800*12=9600>>9600 kilometers.
So in two years, Nina would be able to make 4800 + 9600 = <<4800+9600=14400>>14400 kilometers.

First find the chance that the normal teacher comes in by subtracting the odds she doesn't from 100%: 100% - 50% = 50%
Then find the chance the teacher doesn't grant the whole class an extension by subtracting the chance she does from 100%: 100% - 40% = 60%
Then find the chance that Marcus can't get a personal extension by subtracting the chance he does from 100%: 100% - 20% = 80%
Now find the chance the teacher comes in AND doesn't grant the whole class an extension by multiplying the two independent probabilities: .6 * .5 = <<.6*.5=.3>>.3
Now multiply that probability by the probability Marcus can't get a personal extension to find the probability he actually has to turn in his homework: .3 * .8 = <<.3*.8=.24>>.24
Finally, multiply the decimal probability by 100 to express it as a percentage: .24 * 100% = <<.24*100=24>>24%

Since $133 is equal to 7% of her earnings, then 1% is equal to $133/7 = $<<133/7=19>>19.
The total monthly earning of Zilla is represented by 100%, so $19 x 100 = $<<19*100=1900>>1900 is her monthly earnings.
So, $1900/2 = $<<1900/2=950>>950 is spent on her other monthly expenses.
The total amount spent on the rent and other monthly expenses is $133 + $950 = $<<133+950=1083>>1083.

First figure out how much money Nigella earned from commission by subtracting her base salary from her total earnings: $8,000 - $3,000 = $<<8000-3000=5000>>5,000.
Next, figure out how much all three houses cost by dividing Nigella's commission money by her commission rate: $5,000 ÷ 0.02 = $<<5000/0.02=250000>>250,000.
Next, express each house's price in terms of A's price: B = 3A, and C = 2A - $110,000.
Now we know that A + 3A + 2A - $110,000 = $250,000.
We can combine like terms to find that 6A - $110,000 = $250,000.
Now we add $110,000 to both sides of the equation and get 6A = $360,000.
We can divide both sides by 6 to find A = $60,000.
#### 60000

If the total cost of an orange and a pear is $120, and a pear costs $90, an orange costs $120-$90 = $<<120-90=30>>30
Since the difference between the price of an orange and a pear is the price of a banana, a banana is sold at $90-$30 = $<<90-30=60>>60
To buy 200 bananas, you'll pay $60*200 = $<<60*200=12000>>12000
When you twice as many oranges as bananas, you buy 2*200 = <<2*200=400>>400 oranges.
The total cost of buying 400 oranges is 400*30 = $<<400*30=12000>>12000
The total price of buying 200 bananas and twice as many oranges as bananas is $12000+$12000 = $24000

Eating three times a day, a dog eats 3*4=<<3*4=12>>12 pounds of food.
Since there are 3 dogs at the camp, the total amount of food they eat is 3*12=<<3*12=36>>36 pounds of food in a day.
If each dog eats twice as much food as a puppy, a puppy will eat 4/2=<<4/2=2>>2 pounds of food in one meal.
Each puppy eats three times as often as a dog, and if a dog eats three times in a day, a puppy will eat 3*3= <<3*3=9>>9 times in a day.
Since a puppy eats 2 pounds of food a day, the total amount of food a puppy will eat in a day is 9*2=<<9*2=18>>18 pounds of food.
Four puppies in the camp eat 18*4=<<18*4=72>>72 pounds of food every day.

Let g be the number of green cars, r be the number of red cars, and p be the number of purple cars. We know that g + r + p = 315, r = p + 6, and g = 4r
Substitute the second equation into the third equation to get: g = 4r = 4(p + 6) = 4p + 24
Now substitute the equations that express g and r in terms of p in the equation for the total number of cars: 4p + 24 + p + 6 + p = 315
Now combine like terms to get 6p + 30 = 312
Now subtract 30 from both sides to get 6p = 282
Now divide both sides by 6 to get p = 47

One-third of the classrooms have 30 desks, so there are 1/3 * 15 = <<1/3*15=5>>5 classrooms like that.
The rest, which means 15 - 5 = <<15-5=10>>10 classrooms, have 25 desks.
One-third of the classrooms can fit 5 * 30 = <<5*30=150>>150 students.
The rest can fit 10 * 25 = <<10*25=250>>250 students.
So in total, the school can be filled with 150 + 250 = <<150+250=400>>400 students.
#### 400

The total number of panels required is 20*10 = <<20*10=200>>200 panels.

#### 6

One-half pound of almonds cost $10/2 = $<<10/2=5>>5.
One-fifth pound of almonds cost $10/5 = $<<10/5=2>>2.
A one-third pound of walnuts costs $15/3 = $<<15/3=5>>5.
So, 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts cost $5 + $5 = $10.
And 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts cost $2 + $5 = $7.
Therefore, 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts cost $10 - $7 = $3 more than a mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts.
#### 3

#### 220

Diana’s raise was 20% of her 30-minute video game time, or 0.20 x 30 minutes = <<20*.01*30=6>>6 minutes.
Diana is now making 30 minutes + 6-minute raise = <<30+6=36>>36 minutes for every hour she reads.
Diana read 12 hours x 36 minutes of video game time, so she received 432 minutes of video game time after her raise.
Before, if Diana read 12 hours x 30 minutes of video game time, she would have received 360 minutes.
The amount she received after her raise, 432 minutes – 360 minutes at her old rate = <<432-360=72>>72 more minutes after her raise.
#### 72

In the first route, Malcolm spends 6 minutes * 2 = <<6*2=12>>12 minutes walking along the path.
So in total, the first two stages of this route take him 6 + 12 = <<6+12=18>>18 minutes.
This means the final part of the journey took him 18 / 3 = <<18/3=6>>6 minutes.
Therefore, the total time it takes to walk the first route is 18 + 6 = <<18+6=24>>24 minutes.
In the second route, the second stage takes him 14 * 2 = <<14*2=28>>28 minutes.
So the second route takes a total of 28 + 14 = <<28+14=42>>42 minutes to walk.
The second route therefore takes an extra 42 minutes for the second route – 24 minutes for the first route = <<42-24=18>>18 minutes.
#### 18

#### 320

First find the total number of monthly commutes: 5 days/week * 4 weeks/month = <<5*4=20>>20 days/month
Then multiply the distance of the commute one way by the two ways: 21 miles * 2 = <<21*2=42>>42 miles
Then multiply the number of commutes by the number of miles per commute: 42 miles/commute * 20 commutes = <<42*20=840>>840 miles
Then divide the number of miles by the car's gas mileage: 840 miles / 30 miles/gallon = <<840/30=28>>28 gallons
Then multiply that number by the cost of each gallon to find the total cost: 28 gallons * $2.50/gallon = $<<28*2.5=70>>70
Then divide the total cost by the number of friends to find the cost per person: $70 / 5 people = $<<70/5=14>>14/person
#### 14

The bear gained 1 / 5 * 1000 = <<1/5*1000=200>>200 pounds from berries.
It gained 2 * 200 = <<2*200=400>>400 pounds from acorns.
It still needed 1000 - 200 - 400 = <<1000-200-400=400>>400 pounds.
Thus, it gained 400 / 2 = <<400/2=200>>200 pounds from salmon.
Therefore, the bear gained 400 - 200 = <<400-200=200>>200 pounds from small animals.
#### 200

There are 50 - 40 = <<50-40=10>>10 cartons of canned juice that are left to be loaded on the truck.

First find the total weight of the silverware per setting: 4 ounces/piece * 3 pieces/setting = <<4*3=12>>12 ounces/setting
Then find the total weight of the plates per setting: 12 ounces/plate * 2 plates/setting = <<12*2=24>>24 ounces/setting
Then add those two amounts to find the total weight per setting: 12 ounces/setting + 24 ounces/setting = <<12+24=36>>36 ounces/setting
Then multiply the number of tables by the number of settings per table to find the number of table settings: 15 tables * 8 settings/table = <<15*8=120>>120 settings
Then add the 20 backup settings to find the total number of settings: 120 settings + 20 settings = <<120+20=140>>140 settings
Then multiply the total number of settings by the weight per setting to find the total weight: 140 settings * 36 ounces/setting = <<140*36=5040>>5040 ounces

First find the area of each long side by multiplying the length and width: 8 inches * 6 inches = <<8*6=48>>48 square inches
Then do the same thing for each short side: 5 inches * 6 inches = <<5*6=30>>30 square inches
Now add the area of one long side, one short side, and one top/bottom together: 48 square inches + 30 square inches + 40 square inches = <<48+30+40=118>>118 square inches
Now double that quantity because there are two of each kind of side: 118 square inches * 2 = <<118*2=236>>236 square inches

The Adidas purchase was 1/5 that of Skechers, therefore the Skechers cost 5 * 600 = 3000 dollars.
Spending three times the cost of Adidas on Nike sneakers translates to 3 * 600 = <<3*600=1800>>1800 dollars.
All together, the three athletic-sneaker purchases cost Mimi 600 + 1800 + 3000 = <<600+1800+3000=5400>>5400 dollars.
Subtracting the amount spent on athletic sneakers from the total spent gives 8000 - 5400 = <<8000-5400=2600>>2600 dollars.
Mimi therefore spent 2600 dollars on clothes.
#### 2600

First, figure out how much Bill has before he pays property taxes: $40,000 + $2,000 = $<<40000+2000=42000>>42,000
Then, figure out how much Bill has before he pays sales taxes: $42,000 + $3,000 = $<<42000+3000=45000>>45,000
Next, figure out what percent of his salary Bill keeps after income tax: 100% - 10% = 90%
Now we know that .9g = $45,000, where g is Bill's gross salary
Now we can divide both sides of the equation by .9 to find that g = $50,000
#### 50000

Two pieces of snickers cost $1.5 x 2 = $<<1.5*2=3>>3.

Marge used half the $12006 for taxes, so she had 12006 / 2 = $<<12006/2=6003>>6003 left.
She used 1/3 of the leftover money on student loans, so she paid 6003 / 3 = $<<6003/3=2001>>2001.
After paying the student loans, she had 6003 - 2001 = $<<6003-2001=4002>>4002 left.
She put $1000 in savings, so she had 4002 - 1000 = $<<4002-1000=3002>>3002 left.
She invested 1000 / 5 = $<<1000/5=200>>200 in the stock market.

If the population is halving then at the end of the third year, the population must have been 60 people in the fourth year * 2 = <<60*2=120>>120 people.
In the second year, the population was 120 people in the third year * 2 = <<120*2=240>>240 people.
And in the first year, the population was 240 people in the third year * 2 = <<240*2=480>>480 people.
Additional people moved out in the first year, so accounting for these shows the population was 480 people + 400 people who moved out = <<480+400=880>>880 people.
Then removing the new people shows there were originally 880 people – 100 new people = <<880-100=780>>780 people.

Kevin’s full briefcase is 2 * 8 = <<2*8=16>>16 pounds.
His empty briefcase is 8 / 2 = <<8/2=4>>4 pounds.
The contents of his briefcase weigh 16 - 4 = <<16-4=12>>12 pounds.
His work papers weigh 12 / 6 = <<12/6=2>>2 pounds.
Thus, his laptop weighs 12 - 2 = <<12-2=10>>10 pounds.
Therefore, Kevin’s laptop weighs 10 - 8 = <<10-8=2>>2 pounds more than Karen’s tote.

If the third school had 200 students, and the second school had 40 more students than the third school, the second school had 200+40 = <<200+40=240>>240 students.
The third and second schools had 240+200 = <<240+200=440>>440 students on stage taking part in the debate.
Since the first school had twice as many students as the second school, and the second school had 240 students, the first school had 240*2= <<240*2=480>>480 students on stage taking part in the debate.
If after the debate was over, every student at the stage shook the mayor's hand, the number of students who shook the mayor's hand is 480+440 = <<480+440=920>>920 students
#### 920

First figure out how much the nickels are worth: 2 * 5 cents = <<2*5=10>>10 cents
Then figure out how much the dimes are worth: 7 * 10 cents = <<7*10=70>>70 cents
Finally, add the value of the nickels, dimes and quarter: 25 cents + 10 cents + 70 cents = <<25+10+70=105>>105 cents
#### 105

The number of paintings Philip will make after 30 days is 2 paints/day * 30 days = <<2*30=60>>60 paintings.

#### 80

Abigail had $20 + $40 = $<<20+40=60>>60 left after paying her phone bill.
The $60 is 100% - 25% = 75% of the remainder of her money after spending for food.
Since 75% is $60, then 1% is $60/75 = $<<60/75=0.80>>0.80.
Thus, Abigail had $0.80 x 100 = $<<0.80*100=80>>80 left after she spent money on food.
The $80 is 100% - 60% = 40% of her original money.
So 1% is $80/40 = $<<80/40=2>>2.
Therefore, Abigail initially had $2 x 100 = $<<2*100=200>>200.
#### 200

First multiply Marla's one-way driving time by 2 to find her total driving time: 20 minutes * 2 = <<20*2=40>>40 minutes

First find the total number of chicks: 40 pigeons * 6 chicks/pigeon = <<40*6=240>>240 chicks
Then add that to the number of adult pigeons to find the total number of pigeons: 240 chicks + 40 pigeons = <<240+40=280>>280 pigeons
Then multiply that number by 30% to find the number of pigeons that were eaten: 280 pigeons * 30% = <<280*30*.01=84>>84 pigeons
Then subtract that number from the total number of pigeons to find the number that are left: 280 pigeons - 84 pigeons = <<280-84=196>>196 pigeons
#### 196

This is 8/16 x 100% = 50% of his cards.
#### 50

He orders 100 patches and they cost $1.25 each so the patches are 100*1.25 = $<<100*1.25=125.00>>125.00
He sells each of the 100 patches for $12.00 each so he makes 100*12 = $<<100*12=1200.00>>1,200.00
He makes $1,200.00 selling patches and spends $125.00 to have them made so his net profit is 1200-125 = $<<1200-125=1075.00>>1,075.00
#### 1075

There are 12 dogs and half are standing on their back legs so that means 12/2 = <<12/2=6>>6 are standing on their back legs
A dog has 2 back legs and only 6 are standing on their back legs meaning that there are 2*6 = <<2*6=12>>12 paws on the ground
The other 6 dogs are standing on all 4 legs which means these 6 dogs have 6*4 = <<6*4=24>>24 paws on the ground
When you add them together 12+24 = <<12+24=36>>36 paws on the ground
#### 36

There are 60/100 * 15 = <<60/100*15=9>>9 more green cards than red cards.

#### 27

A total of 4 + 6 = <<4+6=10>>10 cars are in the shop throughout the week.
This means the shop buys 10 cars * 4 tires = <<10*4=40>>40 tires.
For each of the customers that only want half the tires changing, there are 4 tires * 0.5 = <<4*0.5=2>>2 tires left over.
Two of the customers only want half the tires changing, so there are 2 tires * 2 cars = <<2*2=4>>4 tires left over from these customers.
Out of the remaining tires, there are 20 – 4 = <<20-4=16>>16 tires left from customers who don't want their tires changing.
So in total, there were 16 tires / 4 tires per customer = <<16/4=4>>4 customers who did not want their tires changing.

There are three times the number of tadpoles as frogs, so there are 3 * 5 = <<3*5=15>>15 tadpoles.
Two-thirds of the tadpoles will survive to become frogs, so 2 * 15 / 3 = <<2*15/3=10>>10 tadpoles will grow into frogs.
When the tadpoles grow up, there will be 5 + 10 = <<5+10=15>>15 frogs in the pond.
The pond can only sustain 8 frogs, so 15 - 8 = <<15-8=7>>7 frogs will need to find a new pond.

In a year, Thomas earned 52 x 270 = $<<52*270=14040>>14,040
The total for the two years is 14040+2600 = <<14040+2600=16640>>16640
In 2 years, Thomas' weekly expenses amounted to $35 x (52 x 2) = $35 x 104 = $<<35*52*2=3640>>3640
By the end of 2 years, Thomas would have saved $16640 - $3640= <<16640-3640=13000>>13000
Thomas still needs $15,000 - 13000 = $<<15000-13000=2000>>2000

First, we need to determine how many feet Ian runs in a week. We begin this by multiplying the number of laps by the number of feet per lap, performing 5*100= <<5*100=500>>500 feet per day.
Since there are 5 days in the period being measured, this means Ian runs 500*5= <<2500=2500>>2500 feet jogged.
Since it takes 25 feet of jogging to burn a calorie, this means Ian burns 2500/25=<<2500/25=100>>100 calories burned jogging throughout the week.
#### 100

Let x be the number of pairs of shoes that Becky owns.
Since 13 pairs is 5 less than twice as many pairs as Becky owns, then the relationship is 2x-5=13.
Adding 5 to each side of the equation, we get 2x=18.
Solving for x, we get x=<<9=9>>9.
Since Bobby has 3 times as many pairs of shoes as Becky has, then Becky has 3*9=<<3*9=27>>27 pairs of shoes.

There are two walls that are 12' X 10' and two walls that are 16' by 10'. First find the size in square feet of one 12' x 10' wall by multiplying the height and length: 12 ft * 10 ft = <<12*10=120>>120 sq ft
Multiply that quantity by 2 since there are two 12' x 10' walls: 120 sq ft * 2 = <<120*2=240>>240 sq ft
Then find the size in square feet of one 16' x 10' wall by multiplying the height and length: 16 ft * 10 ft = <<16*10=160>>160 sq ft
Multiply that quantity by 2 since there are two 16' x 10' walls: 160 sq ft * 2 = <<160*2=320>>320 sq ft
Now add the square footage of both sets of walls to find the total square footage Martha needs to paint: 240 sq ft+ 320 sq ft = <<240+320=560>>560 sq ft
Now multiply that amount by 3 because Martha needs to add 3 coats: 560 sq ft/coat * 3 coats = <<560*3=1680>>1680 sq ft
Finally, divide the total square footage by Martha's painting rate to find how many hours she needs to finish: 1680 sq ft / 40 sq ft/hour = <<1680/40=42>>42 hours

If we let x be the amount of time, in hours, it will take for Darrel to catch up to the coyote, then we can figure this out.
Because the distance Darrel travels is defined as the length of time Darrel travels (x) and Darrel's speed (20mph), or the expression 2*x.
And the distance the coyote travels is defined as the length of time the coyote travels (x+1 hour) and the coyote's speed (15 mph), or the expression (x+1)*1.
And since the distance Darrel and the coyote travel is the same, then 2*x=(x+1)*1
Simplifying the expression, we get 2*x=x+1.
If we subtract 1 x from each side, we get x=1, the amount of time in hours.

Since the pink frog weighs the same as a blue beetle and a green toad, if the weight of the pick frog is 50 pounds, the three animals weigh 3*50 = 150 pounds together.
The pink frog also weighs 10 pounds less than a yellow snake, meaning the weight of the yellow snake is 50+10 = <<50+10=60>>60 pounds.
If you add the weight of the frog, the blue beetle, the green toad, and the yellow snake together, all the animals minus the red bird will have a total weight of 60+150 = <<60+150=210>>210 pounds.
The pink frog's weight is also 20 pounds more than a red bird, meaning the red bird weighs 50-20 = <<50-20=30>>30 pounds.
All the animals weigh a total of 30+210 = <<30+210=240>>240 pounds
If the animals are in a container weighing 20 pounds, the total weight of the full container is 240+20 = 260 pounds

If he fires a bullet in the same direction as the direction that the horse is running, the total speed of the bullet is the sum of the speed the bullet was propelled out of the gun plus the speed of the horse, for a combined speed of 400+20=<<400+20=420>>420 feet per second.
If he fires a bullet in the opposite direction as the direction in which the horse is running, then the total speed of the bullet is the speed the bullet was propelled out of the gun minus the speed of the horse, for a resulting speed of 400-20=<<400-20=380>>380 feet per second.
Thus, when firing the gun in the same direction as the horse is running, the bullet moves at 420-380=<<420-380=40>>40 feet per second faster than when he fires the bullet in the opposite direction as what the horse is running.
