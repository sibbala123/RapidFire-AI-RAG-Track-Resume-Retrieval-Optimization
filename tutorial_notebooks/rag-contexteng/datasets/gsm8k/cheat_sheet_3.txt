First, we find the number of hours per weekday by subtracting the smaller number time from the larger one, finding 10-4= <<10-4=6>>6 hours per weekday.
As there are 5 weekdays, this means the business is open 6*5=30 hours a week on the weekdays.
Then we find out the amount of time the business is open on a weekend day, using the same process as we did with the weekdays, finding Jean's business is open 10-6= <<10-6=4>>4 hours each weekend day.
Since there are two weekend days, this means they are open 4*2=<<4*2=8>>8 hours on the weekends.
We add these two totals together to find that 30+8= <<30+8=38>>38 hours per week.

First, we must recognize that all pairs of shoes and socks are actually two items each, whereas the pants and the t-shirts are individual items. Therefore there are 20*2= <<20*2=40>>40 individual socks in 20 pairs of socks.
Similarly, there are 5*2=<<5*2=10>>10 individual shoes in 5 pairs of shoes.
Therefore, Jonas has 40+10+10+10= <<40+10+10+10=70>>70 individual items in his collection.
To double this number, we perform 70*2=<<70*2=140>>140.
This means we need 140-70=<<140-70=70>>70 new items to double the size.
Since there are 2 individual socks in each pair, we take 70/2= <<70/2=35>>35 new pairs of socks.

At a constant speed of 62 miles/hour, they will drive 2,790 miles / 62 miles/hour = <<2790/62=45>>45 hours in total.
Every 5 hours they take a break, they will take 45 hours / 5 hours/break = <<45/5=9>>9 breaks.
Those breaks will be 9 breaks x 30 minutes/break = <<9*30=270>>270 minutes in total.
In hours, the breaks will be in total 270 minutes ÷ 60 minutes/hour = <<270/60=4.5>>4.5 hours
To find the hotel it took them 30 minutes ÷ 60 minutes/hour = <<30/60=0.5>>0.5 hours
In total, it will take 45 hours + 4.5 hours + 0.5 hours = <<45+4.5+0.5=50>>50 hours to complete the trip.

#### 150

The whole family consists of 4 + 2 + 1 = <<4+2+1=7>>7 persons.
The entrance ticket to the park costs the same for every person, so the family would need to pay 7 * 5 = $<<7*5=35>>35 to enter.
For visiting the attraction the tickets would cost 4 * 2 = $<<4*2=8>>8 for the kids.
Their parents and grandmother would need to pay 3 * 4 = $<<3*4=12>>12.
That means a total cost for the family standing at 35 + 8 + 12 = $<<35+8+12=55>>55.

Bryce and his 4 friends each ordered a pizza with 12 slices, so there were 5 pizzas x 12 slices per pizza = <<5*12=60>>60 slices of pizza.
2/3 of a pizza with 12 slices would be the same as 8/12 because 2/3 x 4/4 = 8/12.
Bryce and two of his friends each ate 2/3 or 8 slices of pizza, so 3 friends x 8 slices of pizza = 24 slices of pizza.
¾ of a pizza with 12 slices would be the same as 9/12 because ¾ x 3/3 = 9/12.
Bryce’s two remaining friends each ate ¾ or 9 slices of pizza, so 2 friends x 9 slices = <<2*9=18>>18 slices of pizza.
Together, Bryce and his friends ate 24 + 18 = <<24+18=42>>42 slices of pizza.
Of the 60 total slices of pizza, the friends ate 42, and 60 slices – 42 slices = <<60-42=18>>18 slices of pizza were left.
#### 18

Three years from now, Kate will be 29 years + 3 years = <<29+3=32>>32 years old.
So by that time, Tully will be 32 years x 2 = <<32*2=64>>64 years old.
This means, Tully is 64 years - 3 years = <<64-3=61>>61 years old now.
Therefore, Tully was 61 years - 1 year = 60 years old last year.

Since the hypotenuse of a triangle is found by the square root of the base squared plus the height squared.
The square of the base of the first triangle is 4*4=<<4*4=16>>16 square inches
The square of the height of the first triangle is 3*3=<<3*3=9>>9 square inches.
The sum of the squares of the base and the height of the first triangle is 16+9=<<16+9=25>>25
The square root of the sum of the base and the height of the first triangle, which is the hypotenuse of the triangle, is √25=5 inches.
Since the perimeter of a triangle is found by adding the sides of the triangle, the base and height of the triangle sum up to 3+4=<<3+4=7>>7 inches
If you add the hypotenuse of the triangle the perimeter of the triangle becomes 7+5=<<7+5=12>>12 inches.

First find the weight of food Karen eats every hour: 2 pounds * 1/3 = 2/3 pounds food.
Then find the total amount of weight Karen's backpack loses per hour she hikes: 2 pounds water/hour + 2/3 pound food/hour = 8/3 pounds/hour.
Multiply this by the number of hours she hikes to find the total amount of weight she loses: 8/3 pounds/hour * 6 hours = <<8/3*6=16>>16 pounds.
Add the weight of all her items to find total starting weight: 20 pounds + 10 pounds + 20 pounds = <<20+10+20=50>>50 pounds.
Then subtract the weight she loses from the starting weight to find the weight after 6 hours: 50 pounds - 16 pounds = <<50-16=34>>34 pounds

Let X be the number of children in the group.
The number of adults in the group is X+<<+25=25>>25.
The group pays 8*X + 15*(X+25) = $720.
Multiplying through the parentheses, we get 8X + 15X + 375 = $720
Combining like terms, we get 23X + 375 = 720
Subtracting 375 from both sides, we get 23X = 720 - 375 = $345
Dividing both sides by 23, we get X = $345 / 23 = <<345/23=15>>15 children.

The cost of the 200 employees is 200 employees * $12/employee/hour = $<<200*12=2400>>2400 per hour.
The cost of the 40 employees is 40 employees * $14/employee/hour = $<<40*14=560>>560 per hour.
The rest means 300 employees - 200 employees - 40 employees = <<300-200-40=60>>60 employees.
These 60 employees' employment costs are at 60 employees * $17/employee/hour = $<<60*17=1020>>1020 per hour.

First figure out how many silver coins the 100 gold coins are worth by multiplying the number of gold coins by the exchange rate between gold and silver: 100 gold * 3 silver/gold = <<100*3=300>>300 silver
Then add the value of the gold in silver to the number of silver coins to find the total value of the gold and silver expressed in silver coins: 300 silver + 60 silver = <<300+60=360>>360 silver
Now multiply that value by the exchange rate between silver and copper to express its value in terms of copper coins: 360 silver * 8 copper/silver = <<360*8=2880>>2880 copper
Then add the value of the gold and silver expressed in copper coins (the value from the last step) to the number of copper coins to find the total value of the hoard: 2880 + 33 = <<2880+33=2913>>2913

First, we need to determine which neighborhood is the better choice by comparing the number of boxes sold. A has 10 houses which will buy 2 boxes each, meaning A will give Jenny 10*2=<<10*2=20>>20 box sales
Neighborhood B has 5 homes which will each buy 5 boxes, meaning she will sell 5*5=<<5*5=25>>25 boxes by going to that neighborhood.
Since 25>20, this means Jenny should choose neighborhood B.
Since Jenny earns $2 per box sold, this means she will earn 25*2=<<25*2=50>>50 dollars by choosing neighborhood B.
