The cafeteria used 100 lasagnas * 2 pounds of ground mince = <<100*2=200>>200 pounds of ground mince for the lasagnas.
This means they used 500 pounds of ground mince in total – 200 pounds of ground mince for the lasagnas = 300 pounds of ground mince for the cottage pies.
So they must have made 300 pounds of ground mince for the cottage pies / 3 pounds of ground mince per cottage pie = <<300/3=100>>100 cottage pies.

On Monday, Steve was paid 8 * 2 = <<8*2=16>>16 dollars
Tuesday’s harvest was 3 * 8 = <<3*8=24>>24 pounds
The 24 pounds Steve picked on Tuesday gave him 24 * 2 = <<24*2=48>>48 dollars
So, the amount Steve earned from the first two days on the job is 16 +48 = <<16+48=64>>64 dollars
Since Steve rested on Wednesday, he made 0 dollars, meaning his earnings were 64 + 0 = <<64+0=64>>64 dollars
The difference between Steve’s earnings and his target is 100 - 64 = <<100-64=36>>36 dollars
Since he was paid 2 dollars for each pound of lingonberries, Steve needed to pick 36/2 = <<36/2=18>>18 pounds

Given the limited capacity of his transport vehicle (20 head of cattle), the 400 head of cattle will require 400/20=<<400/20=20>>20 trips using his transport vehicle.
Traveling to the site at 60 mph for 60 miles it will take 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour to travel one-way.
Since each trip requires driving to and returning from the relocation site, each complete round trip will take 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 hours.
Thus, 20 complete trips will take 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 hours of driving time.
#### 40

She needs 60 inches of rope because 10 x 6 equals <<10*6=60>>60
The six-foot length of rope is 72 inches long because 6 x 12 = <<6*12=72>>72
The six-foot length of rope would give her 12 pieces because 72 / 6 = <<72/6=12>>12
The six-foot length is long enough because 12 > 10
Each 1-foot rope equals 12 inches
She would need 5 of the 1-foot ropes because 60 / 12 = <<60/12=5>>5
If she bought one-foot ropes it would cost $6.25 because 5 x 1.25 = 6.25
The cheapest rope to buy is the 6-foot rope because 5 < 6.25

After 30 days, there will be enough food left to sustain 300 people for 90 days – 30 days = 60 days.
After the 100 people leave, there will be 300-100 = <<300-100=200>>200 people left.
The 200 people will eat 200/300 = 2/3 as much food as the original group of people in the castle.
The 60 days' worth of food will last this smaller group for 60 days / (2/3) = <<60/(2/3)=90>>90 more days.
#### 90

12 hours after 5 pm is 5 am.
If Cameron wants to leave at 10 am, he must pay for an additional 10 am - 5 am = <<10-5=5>>5 hours.

First find how much money the ex made during the first 3 years by multiplying his annual earnings by the number of years: 3 years * $30,000/year = $<<3*30000=90000>>90,000/
Then find how much his raise was by multiplying his salary by the percentage raise: $30,000/year * 20% = $<<30000*20*.01=6000>>6,000/year
Then add the raise to his original salary to find his new salary: $6,000/year + $30,000/year = $<<6000+30000=36000>>36,000/year
Then find how much he made working at the new salary by multiplying it by the 4 years he worked: 4 years * $36,000/year = $<<4*36000=144000>>144,000
Add his earnings from the three years and the four years to find his total earnings: $144,000 + $90,000 = $<<144000+90000=234000>>234,000
Now multiply his total earnings by 30% to find how much he was supposed to pay: $234,000 * 30% = $<<234000*30*.01=70200>>70,200
Now subtract the amount he paid from this number to find how much he owes: $70,200 - $1,200 = $<<70200-1200=69000>>69,000
#### 69000

Mrs. Amaro has 80 x 3/4 = <<80*3/4=60>>60 red roses.
So, 80 - 60 = <<80-60=20>>20 roses are not red.
Then, 20 x 1/4 = 5 of those 20 non-red roses are yellow.
Hence, 20 - 5 = <<20-5=15>>15 roses are white.
Therefore, 60 + 15 = <<60+15=75>>75 roses are either red or white.
#### 75

3 other people are bidding on the desk so there are 3 bids * $50 per bid = $<<3*50=150>>150 added to the cost of the desk by other people.
Carmen also has to bid against each person, so she also adds 3 bids * $50 per bid = $<<3*50=150>>150 to the overall cost.
So in these bids, there has been a total of $150 + $150 = $<<150+150=300>>300 added to the initial cost of the desk.
The desk therefore costs $200 opening bid + $300 added cost = $<<200+300=500>>500.

Isabela bought twice as many cucumbers as pencils, meaning she bought 100/2 = <<100/2=50>>50 pencils.
The total cost for purchasing the pencils without the discount is 50*$20 = $<<50*20=1000>>1000
At a 20% discount, Isabela paid 20/100*$1000 = $<<20/100*1000=200>>200 less.
The total amount of money she used to buy the pencils is $1000-$200 = $<<1000-200=800>>800
She also bought the cucumbers at a total cost of $20*100=$<<20*100=2000>>2000

If it takes Hugo twice the amount of time to fold a medium box than a small box, then he needs 2*3 = <<6=6>>6 seconds for the medium box
If Tom can fold either the small or medium box in 4 seconds, then he's faster at folding the medium box than Hugo because 4s < 6s
If Hugo can fold the small box in 3 seconds, then he's faster at folding the small boxes than Tom because 3s < 4s
Therefore Hugo should fold all small boxes and Tom should fold all the medium ones before doing the other size where they are slower
If there are 2400 small boxes and Hugo can fold 1 box in 3 seconds, then it would take him 2400*3 = <<2400*3=7200>>7200 seconds to fold all boxes
If there are 1800 medium boxes and Tom can fold 1 box in 4 seconds, then it would take him 1800*4 = <<1800*4=7200>>7200 seconds to fold all medium boxes
Given that they need the same amount of time to fold all boxes, and are doing it simultaneously they will need 7200 seconds to fold all the boxes

#### 36

The Saturday morning exodus out of the park comprised 4*2880 = <<4*2880=11520>>11520 elephants
This means that after the exodus, the park was left with 30000 - 11520 = <<30000-11520=18480>>18480 elephants
Since the final number of elephants was 28,980, the new elephants that entered were 28980 - 18480 = <<28980-18480=10500>>10500
The rate at which the new elephants entered the park was therefore 10500/7 = <<10500/7=1500>>1500 elephants/hour
#### 1500

The puppy will consume 60*2 = <<60*2=120>>120 ounces of the special dog food in the first 60 days.
This leaves 365 - 60 = 305 days where the puppy will consume 4 ounces of food per day, or 305*4 = 1220 ounces of the special food.
Thus, the puppy requires a total of 120 + 1220 = <<120+1220=1340>>1340 ounces of food before it is 1 year old.
Each 5-pound bag contains 5*16 = <<5*16=80>>80 ounces of special dog food.
Therefore, the puppy will need to eat 1340/80 = 16.75 bags of the special dog food, meaning the family will need to buy 17 bags.
#### 17

Let x be the number of $10 bills.
So, there are (x + 1) $20 bills.
Adding the $10 and $20 bills should sum up to $80 so the equation is 10x + 20(x + 1) = 80.
Then, distribute 20 to x + 1 so it becomes 10x + 20x + 20 = 80.
Combining the like terms on the left side gives 30x + 20 = 80.
Then transfer 20 to the right side of the equation, so it becomes 30x = 60.
To solve for x, we have 60/30 = <<60/30=2>>2.
Therefore, there are 2 $10 bills.

If 40% of the guests are females, then there are 40/100*200 = <<40/100*200=80>>80 female guests at the party.
The number of female guests wearing rabbit ears is 80/100* 80=<<80/100*80=64>>64
The number of male guests is 200 guests - 80 female guests = <<200-80=120>>120.
If 60% of the male guests are wearing rabbit ears, then there are 60/100 *120 = <<60/100*120=72>>72 male guests wearing rabbit ears.
The total number of guests wearing rabbit ears is 64+72 = <<64+72=136>>136
#### 136

Mrs. Lacson sold a total of 20 + 15 = <<20+15=35>>35 sweet potatoes.
Hence, there are still 80 - 35 = <<80-35=45>>45 sweet potatoes left unsold.

The second and third tank each have 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 fish
So in total there are 20+40*2=<<20+40*2=100>>100 fish
#### 100

The driving time is 480/60= <<480/60=8>>8 hours
The time for breaks was 30+15+15=<<30+15+15=60>>60 minutes
So she spent 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour for rest stops.
So it took her 8+1=<<8+1=9>>9 hours

First find the number of fish the gharials need to eat: 9 gharials * 15 fish/gharial = <<9*15=135>>135 fish
Then find the number of frogs by multiplying that quantity by the number of frogs per fish: 135 fish * 8 frogs/fish = <<135*8=1080>>1080 frogs
Then multiply the number of frogs by the number of flies each frog eats to find the number of flies: 1080 frogs * 30 flies/frog = <<1080*30=32400>>32,400
#### 32400
