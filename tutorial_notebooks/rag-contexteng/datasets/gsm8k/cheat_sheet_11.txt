At this point in the season, Donovan has scored 26 * 15 = <<26*15=390>>390 points.
To reach his goal of 30 points per game, he would have to finish the season with a total of 30 * 20 = <<30*20=600>>600 points.
For the remaining 5 games, Donovan needs to score 600 - 390 = <<600-390=210>>210 points.
Therefore, he needs to average 210 / 5 = <<210/5=42>>42 points per game.
#### 42

Percentage means per 100, so if she still owes 75%, she must have paid 100% - 75% = 25% of the original amount.
25% of the original amount = (25/100)*original amount = $125
Multiplying both sides by (100/25) gives: original amount = (100/25)*$125 = $<<(100/25)*125=500>>500
#### 500

The 10 people shovel 10,000 pounds per 10 days, or 10,000/10=<<10000/10=1000>>1000 pounds per day per 10 people.
And 1000 pounds per day per 10 people is 1000/10=<<1000/10=100>>100 pounds per day per person.
Half of ten people is 10/2=<<10/2=5>>5 people.
At 100 pounds per day per person, 5 people can shovel 5*100=<<5*100=500>>500 pounds per day.
Therefore, for 5 people to shovel 40,000 pounds, it will take 40,000/500=<<40000/500=80>>80 days.

The offices ordered a total of 3 offices * 10 sandwiches each = <<3*10=30>>30 sandwiches.
So the group of customers must have ordered 54 total sandwiches – 30 sandwiches for the offices = <<54-30=24>>24 sandwiches.
This is a total of 24 sandwiches / 4 sandwiches per customer = <<24/4=6>>6 customers who ordered a sandwich.
As only half the group ordered a bacon sandwich, the entire group must have consisted of 6 customers * 2 = <<6*2=12>>12 customers.
#### 12

Twice the length of Christopher's sword is 15 x 2 = <<15*2=30>>30 inches.
So, Jameson's sword is 30 + 3 = <<30+3=33>>33 inches long.

First find how many lizards you get for one gallon of water: 3 lizards / 5 gallons = <<3/5=.6>>.6 lizards/gallon
Then figure out how many lizards 80 gallons of water is worth: 80 gallons * .6 lizards/gallon = <<80*.6=48>>48 lizards
Then figure out how many bottle caps 48 lizards is worth: 48 lizards * 8 bottle caps/lizard = <<48*8=384>>384 bottle caps
Then figure out how many bottle caps Marla can save each day by subtracting the number she spends from the number she finds: 20 bottlecaps/day - 4 bottlecaps/day = <<20-4=16>>16 bottlecaps/day
Finally, divide the number of bottle caps Marla needs by the number she saves each day: 384 bottle caps / 16 bottle caps/day = <<384/16=24>>24 days

Let p be the cost of a full-priced pen.
We know that the first 10 pens are sold at the regular price, so they cost 10*p.
We also know the any pens purchased after the first 10 are half-price, so they cost (20 pens - 10 pens) * p/2 on those.
If we add the cost of the first 10 pens and the pens sold at half-price it equals the total purchase of price of $30=10*p + (20-10)*p/2.
Thus, $30 = 10*p + 10 * p/2.
And, $30 = 10 *p + 5*p.
So, $30 = 15* p.
Finally, p=$<<2=2>>2.

Let x be the amount of the discount.
We have, 22 - x = $16
We change the writing of the equation:
22 - x + x = 16 + x
So, 22 = 16 + x
We then Remove 16 from both sides:
22 - 16 = 16 + x - 16
So, 22 - 16 = x
So, the amount of the discount is x = $<<6=6>>6.

The first team will finish the relay in 4*55 = <<4*55=220>>220 seconds.
On the second team we must determine each runner's individual pace. We know the first runner will complete their leg in 60 seconds, so the second runner will take 60 - 3 = 57 seconds, then the third will take 57 - 3 = 54 seconds, and the fourth will take 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.
Thus, the second team will finish the relay in 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = <<60+57+54+51=222>>222 seconds.
Therefore, the first team will finish 222 - 220 = <<222-220=2>>2 seconds faster than the second team.

Since time is obtained by dividing distance and speed, then Skye took 3 km/150 km per hr. = 1/50 of an hour to finish the first 3 kilometers of the race.
His speed on the next 2 kilometers was 150 + 50 = <<150+50=200>>200 kilometers per hour.
Hence, it took him 2 km/200 km per hr. = 1/100 of an hour to finish the next 2 kilometers.
His speed on the remaining 1 kilometer is 150 x 2 = <<150*2=300>>300 kilometers per hour.
Hence, it took him 1/300 of an hour to finish the 1 kilometer.
So, the total time it took for Skye to complete the race was 1/50 + 1/100 + 1/300 = 1/30 of an hour.

We know that the top level just has one case. Since each level has one more case per side than the level above it, the second level has sides that are 2 cases long.
We can figure out how many cases we need for the second level by finding the area of a square with a side length of 2: 2 cases * 2 cases = <<2*2=4>>4 cases
The third level has three cases per side, so we need to find the area of a square with side length 3: 3 cases * 3 cases = <<3*3=9>>9 cases
The fourth level has a side length of 4, so we find its area with 4 cases * 4 cases = <<4*4=16>>16 cases
Finally, we add up the number of cases we need on each level: 1 cases + 4 cases + 9 cases + 16 cases = <<1+4+9+16=30>>30 cases

Lucas counts a total of 3 confirmed clients + 5 potential clients = <<3+5=8>>8 clients.
Each week, he will need a total of 8 clients * 2 bottles of bleach per client = <<8*2=16>>16 bottles of bleach.
Each week, he will also need a total of 8 clients * 1 pack of cloths per client = <<8*1=8>>8 packs of cloths.
The bottles of bleach will cost him 16 bottles of bleach * $2 per bottle of bleach = $<<16*2=32>>32.
The packs of cloths will cost him 8 packs of cloths * $5 per pack of cloths = $<<8*5=40>>40.
So each week, Lucas' total expenses will be $32 for bleach + $40 for packs of cloths = $<<32+40=72>>72.
His profit will therefore be $92 total income - $72 total expenses = $<<92-72=20>>20.

The height of the sunflowers from Packet A is the same as the height of the sunflowers from Packet B + 20%. If Y represents the height of the sunflowers from Packet B, Y + 0.20Y = the height of sunflowers from Packet A.
We know the height of the sunflowers from Packet A is 192 inches = Y + 0.20Y or 1.2Y.
To figure out Y, we would divide both sides of the equation by 1.2, like this: 192 / 1.2 = 1.2Y / 1.2 or 160 = Y.

6 builders can build a single floor 6 builders / 3 builders = <<6/3=2>>2 times as fast as 3 builders.
Thus 6 builders would build a single floor in 30 days / 2 = 15 days
There are 5 hours x 6 floors/house = <<5*6=30>>30 floors in total in 5 houses with 6 floors each.
Therefore 6 builders would complete the project in 15 days/floor x 30 floors = 450 days.
