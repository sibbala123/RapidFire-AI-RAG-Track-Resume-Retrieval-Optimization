Jeff's beach has 3*20 = <<3*20=60>>60 sandcastles, three times as many as the number of sandcastles in Mark's beach.
The number of towers in each of the sandcastles on Jeff's beach is 1/2*10 = <<1/2*10=5>>5
Since each sandcastle has 5 towers on Jeff's beach, there are 5*60 = <<5*60=300>>300 towers.
In total, on Jeff's beach, there are 300+60 = <<300+60=360>>360 towers and sandcastles.
Altogether, 360+220 = <<360+220=580>>580 sandcastles and towers can be found on their beaches.

If Calen lost 10 pencils, which left him with 10 pencils, then Calen originally had 10+10=<<10+10=20>>20 pencils.
Calen originally had 5 more pencils than does Caleb, and thus Caleb has 20-5=<<20-5=15>>15 pencils.
Let's let "x" represent the number of pencils owned by Candy.
Since Caleb has 3 less than twice as many pencils as does Candy, then (2*x)-3=15.
This simplifies to 2*x=18.
Thus, the number of pencils owned by Candy is x=<<9=9>>9 pencils.

All together, they need to raise ($450 x 6) + $3000 = $<<450*6+3000=5700>>5700
The raised $600 + $900 + $400 = $<<600+900+400=1900>>1900 the first 3 days.
For the next 4 days, they only raised $1900/2 = $<<1900/2=950>>950
In the week, they raised $1900 + $950 = $<<1900+950=2850>>2850
They still need $5700 - $2850 = $<<5700-2850=2850>>2850
Each person still needs $2850/6 = $<<2850/6=475>>475

White women's T-shirts cost $5 less, or ($20/shirt - $5/shirt) * 10 shirts = $15/shirt * 10 shirts = $150.
Black men's t-shirts cost, $18/shirt * 10 shirts = $<<18*10=180>>180.
Black women's T-shirts cost $ 5 less, so ($18/shirt - $5/shirt) * 10 shirts = $13/shirt * 10 shirts = $<<(18-5)*10=130>>130.
Now add up all these quantities to find the total: $200 + $150 + $180 + $130 = $<<200+150+180+130=660>>660.

Let g be the number of shows Gina chooses and s be the number her sister chooses. We know that g = 3s and g + s = 24
Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 3s + s = 24
Combining like terms, we get 4s = 24
Dividing both sides by 4, we get s = 6
Substituting this value back into g = 3s, we get g = 3 * 6 = <<3*6=18>>18
Then multiply the number of shows by the length of each show in minutes to find the total number of minutes Gina chooses: 18 shows * 50 minutes/show = <<18*50=900>>900 minutes

First, you need to set up the problem with the information given. The cost of the skirts and art supplies must equal $<<50=50>>50.
Since we know that the cost of the skirts is the same price and that she bought art supplies for $20, we can set up an equation: 2x + 20 = 50, with x being the cost of the skirts.
To solve the equation, subtract 20 from both sides, to give you the new equation: 2x = 30.
Solve for x by dividing both sides of the equation by 2, 2x/2 = 30/2 gives you x = 15.
Therefore, each skirt cost $<<15=15>>15.

First we find how many cookies Betty will eat in a week by multiplying her daily amount by 7, meaning 7*3=<<21=21>>21 cookies eaten in a week.
We repeat this for the brownies, finding she eats 7*1=<<7*1=7>>7 brownies in a week.
We subtract the 21 cookies from the original amount of 60, finding 60-21= <<60-21=39>>39 cookies remaining.
We repeat this step for the brownies, finding 10-7= <<10-7=3>>3 brownies remaining.
In the end, therefore, Betty has 39-3= <<39-3=36>>36 more cookies than brownies.

Three times the number of Doberman puppies is 3*20=<<3*20=60>>60
Five less than three times the number of Doberman puppies is 60-5=<<60-5=55>>55
Let's say the number of Schnauzers is s.
The difference between the number of Doberman puppies and the number of Schnauzers is s-20
Five less than three times the number of Doberman puppies plus the difference between the number of Doberman puppies and the number of Schnauzers is equal to 90, meaning 55+s-20=90.
The number of Schnauzers which is s+55-20=90
This evaluates to s+35=90
There are s=<<55=55>>55 Schnauzers

Thus, a pint of strawberries not on sale costs 324 / 54 = $<<324/54=6>>6.
Hence, a pint of strawberries costs 6 - 4 = $<<6-4=2>>2 more when not on sale.

William spends 4 + 7 + 4 + 9 = <<4+7+4+9=24>>24 minutes washing a normal car.
He washed 2 normal cars, so he spent 24 * 2 = <<24*2=48>>48 minutes on the normal cars.
He took twice as long as one car for the SUV, so he took 24 * 2 = <<24*2=48>>48 minutes on the SUV.
Thus, William spent 48 + 48 = <<48+48=96>>96 minutes washing all the vehicles.
#### 96

#### 180

Jerry took 2*8 = 24 hours fixing the broken kitchen counter
Together, painting the house and fixing the broken kitchen counter took him 24+8 = <<24+8=32>>32 hours.
If he also took 6 hours mowing the lawn, the total time he spent working for Miss Stevie is 32+6 = <<32+6=38>>38
Since he charged $15 per hour of work, he was paid 38*$15 = $<<38*15=570>>570
#### 570

First find the total cost of the beef: $11/pound * 3 pounds = $<<11*3=33>>33
Then find the total cost of the fruits and vegetables: $4/pound * 8 pounds = $<<4*8=32>>32
Then find the total cost of the spices: $6/jar * 3 jars = $<<6*3=18>>18
Now add the cost of all the items to find Martha's total spending: $33 + $32 + $18 + $37 = $<<33+32+18+37=120>>120
Now divide 50 points by $10 to find now many points Martha gets per dollar: 50 points / $10 = <<50/10=5>>5 points/dollar
Now multiply this exchange rate by Martha's total spending to find how many points she gets before the bonus: $120 * 5 points/dollar = <<120*5=600>>600 points
Finally, add the 250 point bonus Martha gets for spending more than $100: 600 points + 250 points = 850 points
#### 850

Gabrielle saw 5 + 4 + 3 = <<5+4+3=12>>12 birds.
Chase saw 2 + 3 + 5 = <<2+3+5=10>>10 birds.
So, Gabrielle saw 12 - 10 = <<12-10=2>>2 more birds than Chase.
Therefore, Gabrielle saw 2/10 x 100% = 20% more birds than Chase.
#### 20

Three bracelets cost 3 x $15 = $<<3*15=45>>45.
Two gold necklaces cost 2 x $10 = $<<2*10=20>>20.
Thus, the total amount is $45 + $20 + $20 = $<<45+20+20=85>>85.
Therefore, Raine gets a change of $100 - $85 = $<<100-85=15>>15.
#### 15

Let M be the number of miles Mona biked on Monday.
Thus, Mona biked 2M miles on Saturday.
In all, Mona biked M + 2M + 12 = 30 miles.
Thus, on Monday and Saturday, she biked M + 2M = 3M = 30 - 12 = 18 miles.
Therefore, on Monday, Mona biked M = 18 / 3 = <<18/3=6>>6 miles.
#### 6

If the two men each bought 30 apples, together they bought 2*30 = <<2*30=60>>60 apples.
Since the two men each bought 30 apples, 20 less than the total number of apples bought by each woman, each woman bought 20+30 = <<20+30=50>>50 apples.
The total number of apples bought by the women is 3*50 = <<3*50=150>>150
Altogether, the two men and three women bought 60+150 = <<60+150=210>>210 apples.
#### 210

First find the area of the lot by multiplying the width and the length: 120 ft * 60 ft = <<120*60=7200>>7200 sq ft.
Then find the area of the square covered in concrete: 40 ft * 40 ft = <<40*40=1600>>1600 sq ft.
Then subtract the concrete area from the total area to find the grassy area: 7200 sq ft - 1600 sq ft = <<7200-1600=5600>>5600 sq ft.
Finally, divide this area by the area each bag covers to find the number of bags: 5600 sq ft / 56 sq ft/bag = <<5600/56=100>>100 bags.
#### 100

If b is the number of spots Bill has and p is the number of spots Phil has, we know that b + p = 59. We also know that b = 2p - 1.
We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to get: 2p - 1 + p = 59
Combining like terms, we get 3p - 1= 59
Adding 1 to both sides, we get 3p = 60
Dividing both sides by 3, we get p = 20
Substituting this back into the equation b = 2p - 1, we get b = 2*20 - 1 = 40 - 1 = <<2*20-1=39>>39
#### 39

The 12 cans of Spam costs $3 x 12 = $<<3*12=36>>36.
The total amount of 3 jars of peanut butter is $5 x 3 = $<<5*3=15>>15.
And the total amount of the 4 loaves of bread is $2 x 4 = $<<2*4=8>>8.
Therefore the total amount he will have to pay is $36 + $15 + $8 = $<<36+15+8=59>>59.
#### 59

The $15 is 1 - 1/4 = 3/4 of the money left.
Since 3/4 is equal to $15, then 1/4 is equal to $15/3 = $5.
So Lucy had $5 x 4 = $<<5*4=20>>20 left after losing 1/3 of her money.
Hence, $20 is 1 - 1/3 = 2/3 of the money that Lucy had at the beginning.
Since 2/3 is equal to $20, then 1/3 is equal to $20/2 = $10.
Therefore, Lucy had $10 x 3 = $<<10*3=30>>30 at the beginning.
#### 30

Mr. Curtis has 325 - 28 = <<325-28=297>>297 hens.

First find how many texts Jennifer's boyfriend sent asking why she wasn't responding: 5 texts * 5 = <<5*5=25>>25 texts
Then add that number to the number of grocery shopping texts: 25 texts + 5 texts = <<25+5=30>>30 texts
Then multiply that number by 10% to find how many texts he sent about calling the police: 30 texts * 10% = <<30*10*.01=3>>3 texts
Then added how many texts of each kind he sent to find the total number of texts he sent: 3 texts + 30 texts = <<3+30=33>>33 texts
#### 33

Andy is stringing 3 racquets with synthetic gut, so those will take 3 synthetic gut jobs * 15 minutes per synthetic gut job = <<3*15=45>>45 minutes.
He is stringing 5 racquets with polyester string, so those will take 5 polyester string jobs * 22 minutes per polyester string job = <<5*22=110>>110 minutes.
He has 4 hybrid string jobs, so those will take 4 hybrid string jobs * 18 minutes per hybrid job = <<4*18=72>>72 minutes.
So Andy should finish stringing all the racquets in 45 minutes + 110 minutes + 72 minutes = <<45+110+72=227>>227 minutes.
#### 227

There were 600 - 240 = <<600-240=360>>360 boys at the beginning of the game.
So, 360 x 1/4 = <<360*1/4=90>>90 boys left early.
And 240 x 1/8 = <<240*1/8=30>>30 girls left early.
A total of 90 + 30 = <<90+30=120>>120 people left early.
Therefore, 600 - 120 = <<600-120=480>>480 people remained to see the end of the game.

If on the return journey to its home, the alligator took 2 more hours than it took to travel to the Nile Delta, Paul took 4+2=<<4+2=6>>6 hours to travel back to its home.
The total time Paul took to travel from its home to the Nile Delta and back is 6+4=<<6+4=10>>10
On his return journey, Paul traveled with six other alligators, and since each alligator traveled for six hours up the Nile to their home, they took a total of 6*6=<<6*6=36>>36 hours to do so.
Together with Paul, all the alligators took 10+36=<<10+36=46>>46 hours traveling between Nile Delta and up the Nile.

First find the number of cats that are females: 6 cats / 2 = <<6/2=3>>3 cats
Then find the total number of kittens born: 7 kittens/cat * 3 cats = <<7*3=21>>21 kittens
Then subtract the 9 kittens that were sold: 21 kittens - 9 kittens = <<21-9=12>>12 kittens
Then add the number of kittens to the number of adult cats to find the total number of cats: 12 kittens + 6 cats = <<12+6=18>>18 cats
Then divide the number of kittens by the total number of cats and multiply by 100% to find the percentage of cats that are kittens: 12 kittens / 18 cats * 100% = 66.666...%, which rounds up to 67%
#### 67

In a week, Jen works for 7.5 hours/day x 6 days = <<7.5*6=45>>45 hours/week
So in a month, she works for 45 hours/week x 4 weeks = <<45*4=180>>180 hours.
180 hours of work is equal to 180 hours x $1.5 = $<<180*1.5=270>>270.
Since she has complete attendance, she will receive a total of $270 + $10 = $<<270+10=280>>280.
