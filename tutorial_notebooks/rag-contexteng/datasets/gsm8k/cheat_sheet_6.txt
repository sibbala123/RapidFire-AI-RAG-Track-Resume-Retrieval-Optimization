She has 3 hens that lay 3 eggs a day so they lay 3*3 = <<3*3=9>>9 eggs a day
The hens lay 9 eggs a day and she wasn't able to collect them for 7 days so that means there are 9*7 = <<9*7=63>>63 eggs
Her neighbor took 12 off the 63 eggs so that leaves 63-12 = <<63-12=51>>51 eggs
Myrtle dropped 5 of the remaining 51 eggs so she has 51-5 = <<51-5=46>>46 eggs

First, subtract the two tourists the anacondas got from the initial 30 tourists: 30 - 2 = <<30-2=28>>28
Next, divide 28 by two to find out how many tourists got poisoned: 28 / 2 = <<28/2=14>>14.
Now figure out how many of the 14 poisoned tourists recovered: 14 / 7 = <<14/7=2>>2.
The total number of surviving tourists is 14 + 2 = <<14+2=16>>16.

Three times the sum of marbles that Atticus, Jensen, and Cruz have is equal to 60, meaning together they have 60/3=<<60/3=20>>20 marbles.
If Atticus has half as many marbles as Jensen, and Atticus has four marbles, Jensen has 2*4=<<4*2=8>>8 marbles.
Together, Atticus and Jensen have 8+4=<<8+4=12>>12 marbles.
Since the sum of marbles that Atticus, Jensen, and Cruz have is equal to 20, and Atticus and Jensen have 12 marbles, Cruz has 20-12=<<20-12=8>>8 marbles.

There are approximately 4 weeks in a month.
The shop owner added 3 bikes every week for 4 weeks for a total addition of 3*4 = <<3*4=12>>12 bikes
The shop owner now has the original number of bikes + <<12=12>>12 bikes
She sold 18 bikes within the same time frame
She now has a total of 45 bikes which is: the original number of bikes + 12 - 18 = <<45=45>>45 bikes
The original number of bikes = 45-12+18 = <<45-12+18=51>>51 bikes
#### 51

The number of students who went out through exit A is 30/100%1000 = 300 students.
The number of students who didn't use exit A is 1000-300 = <<1000-300=700>>700
3/5 of the students used exit B, a total of 3/5*700 = <<3/5*700=420>>420 students.
If 420 of the remaining students who didn't use exit A used exit B, the number who used exit C is 700-420 = 280 students.

On the first three days, towing ten cars a day, the tow truck pulled 3*10 = <<3*10=30>>30 cars.
It pulled four fewer cars each day, which is 10-4 = <<10-4=6>>6 cars on the remaining days.
If it pulled ten cars for three days and four less on the remaining days, then it pulled for 7-3 = 4 days, four cars less each day.
For the four days, the car pulled 6*4= <<6*4=24>>24 cars.
The total number of cars it pulled that week is 24+30 = <<24+30=54>>54 cars.

#### 198

Jack's mother asked him to buy 2 * 4 = <<2*4=8>>8 bottles of water.
Thus Jack bought 4 + 8 = <<4+8=12>>12 bottles of water in total.
Altogether, the bottles of water cost 12 * $2 = $<<12*2=24>>24.
The cheese cost 1/2 * $10 = $<<10*0.5=5>>5.
So Jack spent $24 + $5 = $<<24+5=29>>29 on water and cheese.
Since he started with $100, he now has $100 - $29 = $<<100-29=71>>71 left.

We know that 7-1=6 days the paper weighs 8 ounces
So those contribute 6*8=<<6*8=48>>48 ounces per week
So in total a weekly delivery of papers weighs 48+16=<<48+16=64>>64 ounces
That means it weighs 64/16=<<64/16=4>>4 pounds
So each week he delivers 4*250=<<4*250=1000>>1000 pounds of paper
So in 10 weeks, he delivers 10*1000=<<10*1000=10000>>10000 pounds of paper
That weighs 10000/2000=<<10000/2000=5>>5 tons of paper

First figure out how many minutes 4 hours is: 4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = <<4*60=240>>240 minutes
Then figure out how long the two essays will take by multiplying the time per essay by the number of essays: 2 essays * 1 hour/essay * 60 minutes/hour = <<2*1*60=120>>120 minutes
Use the same method to find the total time spent writing paragraphs: 15 minutes/paragraph * 5 paragraphs = <<15*5=75>>75 minutes
Now subtract the time spent on essays and paragraphs from the total time to find the time spent on all the short answer questions: 240 minutes - 120 minutes - 75 minutes = <<240-120-75=45>>45 minutes
Finally, divide the total time spent on short-answer questions by the time per question to find the number of questions: 45 minutes / 3 minutes/question = <<45/3=15>>15 questions

For the swiss cheese, Miley paid 5 * 6 = $<<5*6=30>>30.
600 grams of blue cheese means 600 / 200 = <<600/200=3>>3 packages.
So for the blue cheese, Miley paid 3 * 8 = $<<3*8=24>>24.
One-third of the blue cheese means 1/3 * 600 = <<1/3*600=200>>200 grams.
So Miley bought only 600 - 200 = <<600-200=400>>400 grams of white cheese.
Which means 400 / 200 = <<400/200=2>>2 packages.
So for the white cheese, Miley paid 2 * 5 = $<<2*5=10>>10.
So in total for all the cheese, Miley paid 30 + 24 + 10 = $<<30+24+10=64>>64.
#### 64

Tony starts with 50 pills and takes 2 pills each 3 times a day, meaning he takes 2*3=6 pills in total.
Tony repeats this process for two days in total, meaning over those two days he takes 2*6= <<2*6=12>>12 pills
Tony then cuts down his pill usage in half, meaning he's now taking 6/2= <<6/2=3>>3 pills a day.
Since he repeats this process for three days, that means he takes 3*3= <<3*3=9>>9 pills for that period.
Adding in the two pills Tony took on the final day, that means he took 12+9+2=<<12+9+2=23>>23 pills.
Since there were 50 pills in the bottle to begin with, this means Tony has 50-23=<<50-23=27>>27 pills remaining.

To solve this problem, we can set up an equation where x represents Brooke’s age and 2x represents Seth’s age and noting that in two years, the sum of their ages is (2x + 2) + (x + 2) = 28.
Then we add all the values together, 3x + 4 = 28.
And we subtract 4 from each side, 3x +4 - 4 = 28 – 4.
Then we divide each side by 3x/3 = 24/3.
We find that x = <<8=8>>8, or Brooke’s age is 8.
Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so Seth is 8 x 2 = <<8*2=16>>16.

Let x be Luna's house rental budget.
The total budget for house and food rental is represented by the equation x + (60x/100) = 240.
The equation becomes 100x + 60x = 24000 after multiplying each term by 100 to get rid of the fraction.
By combining like terms, the equation becomes 160x = 24000.
Thus, the value of x is 24000/160 = <<24000/160=150>>150 which represents the house rental budget.
So, Luna's food budget is $240 - $150 = $<<240-150=90>>90.
Her phone bill budget is $90 x 10/100 = $<<90*10/100=9>>9.

In the hamster cages, there are 10 cages * 5 pieces of straw per hamster cage = <<10*5=50>>50 pieces of straw.
Between the rabbits and the hamsters, there are 50 pieces of straw for hamsters + 20 pieces of straw for rabbits = <<50+20=70>>70 pieces of straw.
As the remaining straw is for the rats, the rats have a total of 160 used pieces of straw – 70 pieces of straw for the hamsters and rabbits = 90 pieces of straws.
So in each cage, there are 90 pieces of straw / 3 cages = <<90/3=30>>30 pieces of straw.
This means that each cage has 30 pieces of straw / 6 pieces of straw per rat = <<30/6=5>>5 rats.

On the first trip, Ishmael sees 28 male whales * 2 = <<28*2=56>>56 female whales.
So in total, he sees 28 male whales + 56 female whales = <<28+56=84>>84 whales on the first trip.
On the second trip, each baby whale travels with its parents which means it travels in a group of 1 baby whale + 2 parents = <<1+2=3>>3 whales/baby whale.
This means there are 8 baby whales * 3 whales/baby whale = <<8*3=24>>24 whales on the second trip.
On the third trip, there are half as many male whales as there were on the first trip, so there must be 28 male whales / 2 = <<28/2=14>>14 male whales.
Adding this to the female whales means he saws 14 males whales + 56 female whales = <<14+56=70>>70 whales on the third trip.
In total, Ishmael saw 84 + 24 + 70 = <<84+24+70=178>>178 whales across the three trips.
#### 178

Tony drank yesterday 100% - 4% = 96% of what he drank two days ago.
Since 96% is 48 ounces, then every 1% is equal to 48/96 = 0.5 ounces of water.
So, Tony drank 0.5 x 100 = <<0.5*100=50>>50 ounces two days ago.
#### 50

Half of the 50 seeds, or 50/2=<<50/2=25>>25 seeds germinated and grew.

In one hour, there are 3 sets of 20 minutes.
So, Joy can read 8 x 3 = <<8*3=24>>24 pages in an hour.
It will take her 120/24 = <<120/24=5>>5 hours to read 120 pages.
#### 5

Let x be the consumption in 90 hours.
We have: 21/7 = 90/x because the heating plant always consumes fuel at the same rate
Multiplying both sides by 7x, we get 21x = 90 * 7
This can be simplified to 21x = 630
So, the consumption in 90 hours is x = 630 / 21 = <<630/21=30>>30 liters.
#### 30

Mortdecai collects a total of 8x2 = <<8*2=16>>16 dozens of eggs.
He sells a total of 3 + 5 = <<3+5=8>>8 dozens of eggs.
So, 16 - 8 = <<16-8=8>>8 dozens of eggs are left.
After using 4 dozens of eggs to make a pie, 8 - 4 = <<8-4=4>>4 dozens of eggs are left.
Since there are 12 in 1 dozen, then Mortdecai donates 4 x 12 = <<4*12=48>>48 pieces of eggs to the charity.
#### 48

Mary originally had 8 screws, then went to buy twice more screws and ended up with 8+(8*2)=<<8+8*2=24>>24 of them.
She then split them into four piles of 24/4=<<24/4=6>>6.
#### 6

If the shadows lengthen by 5 feet per hour, this means that in 6 hours the shadows would have lengthened from zero to 5*6=<<5*6=30>>30 feet.
Since there are 12 inches in every foot, this means the building's shadow would be 30*12= <<30*12=360>>360 inches in length.
#### 360

The discount per one ticket is 10 * 30/100 = $<<10*30/100=3>>3.
So Dorothy's and her brother's tickets are cheaper by 2 * 3 = $<<2*3=6>>6.
Her family consists of 5 people, so the ticket cost stands at 5 * 10 = $<<5*10=50>>50.
Including the discount will lower the price to 50 - 6 = $<<50-6=44>>44 in total.
Dorothy will be left with 70 - 44 = $<<70-44=26>>26.
#### 26

First find how many ounces of fruit Bill will need total: 12 ounces/batch * 4 batches = <<12*4=48>>48 ounces
Then find how many cartons of blueberries Bill would need: 48 ounces / 6 ounces/carton = <<48/6=8>>8 cartons
Then multiply that number by the cost per carton to find the total cost of the blueberries: 8 cartons * $5/carton = $<<8*5=40>>40
Then find how many cartons of raspberries Bill would need: 48 ounces / 8 ounces/carton = <<48/8=6>>6 cartons
Then multiply that number by the cost per carton to find the total cost of the raspberries: 6 cartons * $3/carton = $<<6*3=18>>18
Then subtract the cost of the raspberries from the cost of the blueberries to find the difference: $40 - $18 = $<<40-18=22>>22
#### 22

Michael sold 2 large birdhouses for $22 each, so he made 2*$22= $<<2*22=44>>44 from large birdhouse sales.
Michael also sold 2 medium birdhouses for $16 each, so he made 2*$16= $<<2*16=32>>32 from medium birdhouse sales.
Michael sold 3 small birdhouses for $7 each, so he made 3*7=$<<3*7=21>>21 from small birdhouse sales.
Since Michael made $44 from large birdhouse sales, $32 from medium birdhouse sales, and $21 for small birdhouse sales, he made $44+$32+$21= $<<44+32+21=97>>97 total this week.
#### 97

In the park, 50 benches with a capacity of four people each have a total capacity of 50*4 = <<50*4=200>>200 sitting spaces.

Betty used 2 cups of sugar in her cheesecake, so she used 2 * 1 = <<2*1=2>>2 times her ratio.
Thus, she used 2 * 4 = <<2*4=8>>8 cups of cream cheese.
She uses 1 teaspoon of vanilla for 2 cups of cream cheese, so she used 8 / 2 = 4 teaspoons of vanilla.
For each teaspoon of vanilla, she uses 2 eggs, so she used 2 * 4 = <<2*4=8>>8 eggs.
#### 8

It costs Jen 80 * 50 = <<80*50=4000>>4000 cents to buy 50 candy bars.
Since a dollar is 100 cents, she earns 48 * 100 = <<48*100=4800>>4800 cents by selling 48 of them.
Thus her total profit is 4800 - 4000 = <<4800-4000=800>>800 cents.
#### 800

First find the total number of minutes Gretchen spends sitting at her desk: 6 hours * 60 minutes/hour = <<6*60=360>>360 minutes
Then divide this amount by 90 minutes to find how many walking breaks Gretchen takes: 360 minutes / 90 minutes/break = <<360/90=4>>4 breaks
Then multiply the number of breaks by the length of each break to find how long Gretchen spends walking: 4 breaks * 10 minutes/break = <<4*10=40>>40 minutes
#### 40

The number of children on the bus is 60 passengers * 25% = <<60*25*.01=15>>15 passengers.

#### 23

During three weeks, Bernie buys 3 * 2 = <<3*2=6>>6 chocolates.
In the local store, he pays for them 6 * 3 = $<<6*3=18>>18.
If Bernie would buy the same chocolates in the different store, he would pay 6 * 2 = $<<6*2=12>>12.
So Bernie would be able to save 18 - 12 = $<<18-12=6>>6.
#### 6

Natalie's sister bought 2 * 8 = <<2*8=16>>16 diaries.
So she then had 16 + 8 = <<16+8=24>>24 diaries.

So, Natalie's sister now has 24 - 6 = <<24-6=18>>18 diaries.
#### 18

Let X be the money Mark had. Mark spent 1/2*X + 14 in the first store and 1/3*X + 16 in the second store.
Mark has X - 1/2*X - 14 - 1/3*X - 16 = $0 left.
Combining like terms, we get 1/6*X - 30 = $0.
Adding 30 to both sides and multiplying both sides by 6, we find that Mark had X = $180 when he entered the first store.
#### 180

He needs 400 calories worth of peanut butter because 500 - 100 = <<500-100=400>>400

Subtracting the ones he sold, he has 580 pencils - 350 pencils = <<580-350=230>>230 pencils.
#### 230

Let the total profit of both companies be denoted by x.
Therefore, 40% * x = 0.4 * x = $60000
So x = $60000 / 0.4 = $150000.
If Company B gets 60 % of the profits, it gets 60% of $150000, which is 0.6 * $150000 = $<<0.6*150000=90000>>90000.
#### 90000

He read 8 pages every day for 12 days for a total of 8*12 = <<8*12=96>>96 pages
96 pages is the same as two-thirds of the total number of pages which means: number of pages*(2/3) = 96
Therefore the total number of pages is 96*(3/2) = <<96*(3/2)=144>>144 pages
#### 144

Eustace’s current age must be 39 years old – 3 years = <<39-3=36>>36 years old.
So Milford’s current age must be 36 years old / 2 = <<36/2=18>>18 years old.
So in 3 years, Milford will be 18 years old + 3 years = <<18+3=21>>21 years old.
#### 21

We first need to figure out how many of each type of skeleton there are. Since half the 20 skeletons are adult women, that means there are 20/2=<<20/2=10>>10 adult women's skeletons.
The remaining half, 10, is split between adult men and children, meaning there are 10/2= <<10/2=5>>5 of each.
Since an adult woman has 20 bones in their body, this means that the 10 skeletons have 20*10=<<20*10=200>>200 bones in total.
Since an adult man has 5 more bones in their body than an adult woman, this means they have 20+5= <<20+5=25>>25 bones in their body.
There are 5 adult men, meaning there are 25*5=<<25*5=125>>125 bones in the adult male skeletons in total.
Since a child has half as many bones as the 20 in an adult woman, this means the children have 20/2= <<20/2=10>>10 bones in their body.
Since there are 5 children, this means there are 5*10= <<5*10=50>>50 bones in the children's skeletons in total.
Therefore, altogether there are 50+125+200= <<50+125+200=375>>375 bones in total in the graveyard.

Since the distance between city A and B is 100 miles, and city B and C are 50 more miles apart than city A and B, then city B and C are 100+50 = <<100+50=150>>150 miles apart.
The plane's total flying distance between cities A and C is 100+150= <<100+150=250>>250 miles.
The distance between city C and city D is twice the distance between city B and city C, meaning city C and city D are 2*150 = <<300=300>>300 miles apart.
The plane flies a distance of 250+300 = <<250+300=550>>550 miles from city A to city D.

There is 3 miles uphill because 5 x .6 = <<5*.6=3>>3
This takes him 1.5 hours because 3 / 2 = <<3/2=1.5>>1.5
This takes him 90 minutes because 1.5 x 60 = <<1.5*60=90>>90
40% of the trail is downhill because 100 - 60 = <<100-60=40>>40
There are 2 miles of downhill because 5 x .4 = <<5*.4=2>>2
This takes him 2/3 of an hour because 2 / 3 = (2/3)
This takes him 40 minutes because 60 x (2/3) = <<60*(2/3)=40>>40
It takes him 130 minutes in total because 90 + 40 = <<90+40=130>>130
#### 130

There are 20 x 1/2 = <<20*1/2=10>>10 red roses in each row.
So there are 20 - 10 = <<20-10=10>>10 roses that are not red in each row.
Out of the 10 remaining roses in each row, 10 x 3/5 = <<10*3/5=6>>6 roses are white.
Thus, there are 10 - 6 = <<10-6=4>>4 pink roses in each row.
Therefore, Mrs. Dawson has 4 pink roses each in 10 rows for a total of 4 x 10 = <<4*10=40>>40 pink roses in her rose garden.
#### 40

To calculate Alec's goal number of votes, we need to know that 60 students / 4 = <<60/4=15>>15 students is equal to one-quarter of the class students.
Alec's goal is therefore 15 students * 3 quarters = <<15*3=45>>45 votes.
Half of the class said they will vote for him, so there are already 60 students / 2 = <<60/2=30>>30 votes.
Another 5 students are thinking about voting for him which leaves a total so far of 30 + 5 = <<30+5=35>>35 votes.
This means there are 60 students - 35 voting for Alec = <<60-35=25>>25 students not voting for Alec.
A fifth of these decided to vote, so this is a further 25 students / 5 = <<25/5=5>>5 votes.
Alec is therefore receiving a total of 35 + 5 = <<35+5=40>>40 votes.
So he has missed his goal by 45 goal votes - 40 actual votes = <<45-40=5>>5 votes.
#### 5

Malcolm has bought 12 * 3 = <<12*3=36>>36 blue lights.
This means he has bought a total of 12 + 36 + 6 = <<12+36+6=54>>54 colored lights.
If he still needs to buy more lights, then he must have initially had 54 + 5 = <<54+5=59>>59 white lights.
#### 59

After traveling 110 miles at first, Sid traveled 110 + 140 = <<110+140=250>>250 miles in total
Since he spends 3 hours traveling after the first 2 hours, he traveled 3 + 2 = <<3+2=5>>5 hours
On average, Sid traveled 250 miles / 5 hours = <<250/5=50>>50 miles per hour.
#### 50

There are 900 - 42 = <<900-42=858>>858 feet of path to line.
There are poles every 6 feet, so the company needs 858 / 6 = <<858/6=143>>143 poles.
The poles have to go on both sides of the path, so there will be 143 * 2 = <<143*2=286>>286 fence poles along the whole path.

The 5 paint brushes cost $2 x 5 = $<<2*5=10>>10.
Thus, Marc spent $100 + $50 +$10 = $<<100+50+10=160>>160 in total.
#### 160

Ajax weighs 80 x 2.2 = <<80*2.2=176>>176 in pounds.
He will lose 1.5 x 2 = <<1.5*2=3>>3 pounds per day.
So he will lose 3 x 7 = <<3*7=21>>21 pounds per week.
So, he will lose 21x 2 = <<21*2=42>>42 pounds after 2 weeks.
Therefore, he will weigh 176 - 42 = <<176-42=134>>134 pounds after 2 weeks.
#### 134

Let s be the number of gallons of seed Carson uses and f be the number of gallons of fertilizer. We know that s = 3f and s + f = 60.
Substituting the first equation into the second equation produces 3f + f = 60
Combining like terms, we get 4f = 60
Dividing both sides by 4, we get f = 15
Substituting that value into the equation s = 3f, we get s = 3 * 15 = <<3*15=45>>45

If "x" is the number of European swallows, then, for every one European swallow, there would be 2x American swallows.
Thus, the total number of swallows would be 2x+x=90 swallows
Thus, the number of European swallows x=<<30=30>>30.
And the number of American swallows is 90-30=<<90-30=60>>60.
A European swallow can carry twice what an American swallow can carry, or 2*5=<<2*5=10>>10 pounds.
30 European swallows can carry a maximum of 30*10=<<30*10=300>>300 pounds.
60 American swallows can carry a maximum of 60*5=<<60*5=300>>300 pounds.
