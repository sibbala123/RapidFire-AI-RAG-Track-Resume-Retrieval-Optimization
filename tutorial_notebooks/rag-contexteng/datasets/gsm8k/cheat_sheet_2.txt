The total ratio representing fuel consumption and distance traveled is 4+7=<<4+7=11>>11
If 4/11, which is the fraction representing fuel consumption, represents 22 gallons of gas, then 7/11 representing distance covered represents 7/11 * 44 * 11/4=<<7/11*44*11/4=77>>77 miles.
#### 77

Before the typhoon, their farm had a total of 50 trees + 30 trees = <<50+30=80>>80 trees.
If there was 1 more than Mahogany than Narra tree that fell, then this means there were 2 Narra trees and 2 + 1 = 3 Mahogany trees that fell during the typhoon.
So, Bea's mom planted 2 trees x 2 = <<2*2=4>>4 Narra trees.
She also planted 3 trees x 3 = <<3*3=9>>9 Mahogany trees.
So, her mom planted 4 trees + 9 trees = <<4+9=13>>13 more trees.
After the typhoon, they only had 80 trees - 5 trees = <<80-5=75>>75 trees left.
Therefore, there are 75 trees + 13 trees = <<75+13=88>>88 trees now.
#### 88

Half the mural is yellow, so the other half took 12 / 2 = <<12/2=6>>6 pints of paint.

#### 100

In 3 years, the sum of their present ages will be added by 3 (from Allen) + 3 (from her mother) = <<3+3=6>>6.
So, the sum of their present ages is 41 - 6 = <<41-6=35>>35.
Let x be the present age of Allen's mother and x - 25 be the present age of Allen.
So the equation using the sum of their present ages is x + x - 25 = 35.
By combining like terms, the equation becomes 2x = 60.
Hence, Allen's mother is x = 60/2 = <<60/2=30>>30 years old now.
#### 30

When Mr. Sylas puts an equal number of the cows he bought into the stalls, each stall gets 40/10 = <<40/10=4>>4 new cows.
Each of the stalls gets four cows, meaning a total of 8*4 = <<8*4=32>>32 cows are placed into eight of the stalls.
Since each stall had 20 cows before Mr. Sylas added four into each of the stalls, the total number of cows in eight of the stalls was 8*20= <<8*20=160>>160 cows.
There are 160+32 = <<160+32=192>>192 cows in eight stalls after Mr. Sylas adds four into each of the stalls.

We don't know Yasmin's number of children yet, but let's represent it as Y.
If John has twice the number of children Yasmin has, then John has 2*Y = 2Y kids
If Gabriel has 6 grandkids between John's and Yasmin's children, then we can represent this as 6 = 2Y + Y
If we solve the latest equation then we learn that 6=3Y
Given that Y represents how many kids Yasmin has, then solving for Y we know that Y=6/3 or Y=2 kids

If Dana can skip at half the speed she can run, then she can run at 3*2=<<3*2=6>>6 miles per hour.
And since she can run at a speed that is 4 times faster than she can walk, this means she can walk at 6/4=1.5 miles per hour.
If two-thirds of the time is spent walking, then she walks for 6*(2/3)=<<6*(2/3)=4>>4 hours.
If one-third of the time is spent running, then she runs for 6-4=<<6-4=2>>2 hours.
Thus, she runs for 2 hours at 6 miles per hour, or 2*6=<<2*6=12>>12 miles.
She walks for 4 hours at 1.5 miles per hour, or 4*1.5=<<4*1.5=6>>6 miles.
Thus, altogether, she travels 12+6=<<12+6=18>>18 miles.

The volume of the slab is 100*100*.5=<<100*100*.5=5000>>5000 cubic feet
So it weighs 5000*150=<<5000*150=750000>>750000 pounds
That means the cost is 750000*$0.02=$<<750000*0.02=15000>>15,000 per house
So the total cost for all 3 houses is $15000*3=$<<15000*3=45000>>45,000

48 children took 4 each for a total of 48*4 = <<48*4=192>>192 sweets
If there is 1/3 left then 192 is 1-(1/3) = 2/3 of the original amount (The whole packet minus 1 third)
Therefore 192 is 2/3 of the original amount: (2/3)* original amount = 192
Multiplying both sides of the equation by (3/2) gives: original amount = 192*(3/2) = <<192*3/2=288>>288

Wearing the high-tech shoes, Candace can hike 6 mph * 2 = <<6*2=12>>12 mph for the first two hours.
Then she gets one blister, so her speed drops to 12 mph - 2 mph = <<12-2=10>>10 mph for the next two hours of the hike.
After that time Candace gets another blister, but 2 hours + 2 hours = <<4=4>>4 hours, so the hike is over and we don't care about her speed anymore.
Candace spends an equal amount of time walking at 12 mph and 10 mph, so we can average the two speeds to find an overall speed of (12 mph + 10 mph)/2 = <<(12+10)/2=11>>11 mph.

Margaret finished all of her laps in 10 minutes * 60 seconds = <<10*60=600>>600 seconds.
Billy’s first 5 laps took 2 minutes * 60 seconds = <<2*60=120>>120 seconds.
His next 3 laps took 4 minutes * 60 seconds = <<4*60=240>>240 seconds.
His ninth lap took 1 minute * 60 seconds = <<1*60=60>>60 seconds.
So his first 9 laps took 120 + 240 + 60 = <<120+240+60=420>>420 seconds.
Billy finished swimming his laps before Margaret so all of his laps took a total of 600 – 30 = <<600-30=570>>570 seconds.
This means that it took 570 seconds in total swimming time – 420 seconds in time spent swimming the first 9 laps = 150 seconds for Billy to swim his final lap.

First, let's calculate the price of the BMX bike which is half of the price of one MTB, so it's 500 * 0.5 = $<<500*0.5=250>>250.
Half of the sold bikes were Trekking bikes, which means 300 * 0.5 = <<300*0.5=150>>150 bikes.
15% of the sold bikes were BMX bikes, which means 300 * 15/100 = <<300*15/100=45>>45 bikes.
The remaining bicycles sold were of the MTB type and there were 300 - 150 - 45 = <<300-150-45=105>>105 bikes of this type sold.
That means Marcel earned 150 * 450 = $<<150*450=67500>>67500 from Trekking bikes.
He also earned 45 * 250 = $<<45*250=11250>>11250 from BMX bikes.
MTB bikes got him 105 * 500 = $<<105*500=52500>>52500
In total Marcel earned 67500 + 11250 + 52500 = $<<67500+11250+52500=131250>>131250 during that month.

That means he makes 50*300=$<<50*300=15000>>15000
So his profit was 15000-3000=$<<15000-3000=12000>>12000
#### 12000

The volume of the container is 6*6*15=<<6*6*15=540>>540 cubic inches
That means it can fit 540/.15=<<540/.15=3600>>3600 jelly beans
With 80% packing efficiency, you can fit 3600*.8=<<3600*.8=2880>>2880 jelly beans in there
So that means he guesses 2880*.3=<<2880*.3=864>>864 are red
So his guess is off by 900-864=<<900-864=36>>36
#### 36

Michael’s watermelon weighs 8 pounds and Clay’s weighs 3 times that so it weighs 8*3 = <<8*3=24>>24 pounds

If Zack's classroom had 22 students when he was absent, then the total students in his class are 22+1 = <<22+1=23>>23
If Tina's classroom has as many students as Maura's then T=M
If Zack's classroom has half the amount of total students between Tina and Maura's classrooms then 23 = 1/2* (T+M )
23 = 1/2*(T+M)
We know from above that T=M, therefore 23 = (1/2) * (M+M) or 23 = (1/2)*2M
23 = M
Because T = M, then T is also T=23.
Between the three classes then we have a total of T+M+Z or 23+23+23=<<23+23+23=69>>69
#### 69

The second cat meowed twice as frequently as the three meows per minute from the first cat, for a total of 2*3=<<2*3=6>>6 meows per minute.
The third cat meowed at one-third the frequency of the second cat, for a total of 6/3=<<6/3=2>>2 meows per minute.
Thus, combined, the three cats meow 3+6+2=<<3+6+2=11>>11 times per minute.
In five minutes, the three cats meow 5*11=<<5*11=55>>55 times.
#### 55

#### 510

He ordered 2 pizzas, each cut into 12 slices so that’s 2*12 = <<2*12=24>>24 slices
Stephen ate 25% of the pizza so he ate .25*24 = <<25*.01*24=6>>6 slices
That leaves 24-6 = <<24-6=18>>18 slices
18 slices are left and Pete eats 50% of 18 slices so he eats 18*.50 = <<18*50*.01=9>>9 slices
If there were 18 slices and Pete ate 9 slices then there are 18-9 = <<18-9=9>>9 slices left over

First find how long Mark spends on parking and walking each day: 5 minutes + 3 minutes = <<5+3=8>>8 minutes
Then multiply that number by his number of workdays to find the total walking and parking time: 8 minutes/day * 5 days/week = <<8*5=40>>40 minutes/week
Then multiply the number of long-wait days by the time of each long wait: 2 days/week * 30 minutes/day = <<2*30=60>>60 minutes/week
Then multiply the number of short-wait days by the time of each short wait: 3 days/week * 10 minutes/day = <<3*10=30>>30 minutes/week
Then add the length of time Mark spends on each activity to find the total time spent: 30 minutes/week + 60 minutes/week + 40 minutes/week = <<30+60+40=130>>130 minutes/week

2 heads of lettuce at $1 apiece is 2*$1=$<<2*1=2>>2.
4 tomatoes at $0.50 apiece is 4*$0.5=$<<4*0.5=2>>2.
Thus, each customer purchases $2+$2=$<<2+2=4>>4 in lettuce and tomatoes per month.
Therefore, if 500 customers per month spend $4 on lettuce and tomatoes, then the store will receive $4*500=$<<4*500=2000>>2000 per month on sales of lettuce and tomatoes.
#### 2000

Gab scored 20 x 2 = <<20*2=40>>40 points.
Cher scored 40 x 2 = <<40*2=80>>80 points.
Their team scored 20 + 40 + 80 = <<20+40+80=140>>140 points.
Therefore, they scored 140 - 85 = <<140-85=55>>55 more points than their opponent.
#### 55

For 6 months, Shara was able to return $10 x 6 = $<<10*6=60>>60 to her brother.
Since she already returned half of the money, then this means she currently owes her brother $<<60=60>>60.
Four months from now, she will be able to pay an additional $10 x 4 = $<<10*4=40>>40.
Thus, she will still owe her brother $60 - $40 = $<<60-40=20>>20 four months from now.
#### 20

First find the number of seeds that land in water: 300 seeds * 1/3 = <<300*1/3=100>>100 seeds
Then find the number of seeds that are eaten: 300 seeds * 1/6 = <<300*1/6=50>>50 seeds
Subtract the number of seeds that are destroyed to find the number that sprout: 300 seeds - 100 seeds - 50 seeds = <<300-100-50=150>>150 seeds
Then divide that number by 2 to find the number of sprouts that survive: 150 seeds / 2 = <<150/2=75>>75 seeds

Bob has worked 40 hours/week x 2 weeks = <<40*2=80>>80 regular hours
Bob got paid 80 hours x $5/hour = $<<80*5=400>>400 for his regular hours
Bob worked 44 hours - 40 hours = <<44-40=4>>4 hours of overtime in the first week
Bob worked 48 hours - 40 hours = <<48-40=8>>8 hours of overtime in the second week
In total Bob worker 8 hours + 4 hours =<<8+4=12>>12 hours of overtime.
Bob got paid $6/hour x 12 hours = $<<6*12=72>>72 for overtime
In 2 weeks Bob earned $400 + $72 = $<<400+72=472>>472

Let x be the age of Nina.
So, Leonard's age is x - 4.
And Jerome's age is 2x.
Since the sum of their ages is 36, then the equation is x + x - 4 + 2x = 36.
By combining like terms, the equation becomes 4x = 40.
So the value of x which represents the age of Nina is x = 40/4 = <<40/4=10>>10.
Therefore, Leonard is 10 - 4 = <<10-4=6>>6 years old.

Phil started with 50, and doubled this amount the next year for 50*2=<<50*2=100>>100 coins
Phil then collected 3 per month the following year, and since there are 12 months in a year that was 3*12=<<3*12=36>>36 coins added
Phil then collected 1 every third month, and since there are 12 months that means he collected one every 12/3=4 months, for 4 coins added
Before he lost a quarter of his coins, Phil had 100+36+4 coins, or <<100+36+4=140>>140 coins in total.
Losing a quarter of 140 coins means Phill lost 140/4=<<140/4=35>>35 coins
That means Phil had 140-35= <<140-35=105>>105 coins remaining

First find the total distance of the east-west streets: 18 streets * 2 miles/street = <<18*2=36>>36 miles
Then find the total distance of the north-south streets: 10 streets * 4 miles/street = <<10*4=40>>40 miles
Then add the number of miles from each type of street to find the total distance: 36 miles + 40 miles = <<36+40=76>>76 miles
Then multiply that number by 5 to find the number of miles of cable needed: 76 miles street * 5 miles cable/mile street = <<76*5=380>>380 miles of cable
Then multiply that number by the cost of one mile of cable to find the total cost: 380 miles * $2000/mile = $<<380*2000=760000>>760,000
#### 760000

There are twice as many frogs as dogs in the compound, meaning there are 160/2 = <<160/2=80>>80 dogs.
The total number of frogs and dogs in the compound is 80+160 = <<80+160=240>>240
The number of cats is less than 20% of the number of dogs, which means there are 20/100*80 = <<20/100*80=16>>16 dogs more than the number of cats.
Therefore, the number of cats is 80-16 = <<80-16=64>>64 cats
The total number of animals in the compound is 64 cats +240 dogs and frogs = <<64+240=304>>304 animals.
