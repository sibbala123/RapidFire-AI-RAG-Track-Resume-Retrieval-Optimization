She works 8 hours a day for $18 per hour so she makes 8*18 = $<<8*18=144.00>>144.00 per 8-hour shift
She works 10 hours a day and anything over 8 hours is eligible for overtime, so she gets 10-8 = <<10-8=2>>2 hours of overtime
Overtime is calculated as time and a half so and she makes $18/hour so her overtime pay is 18*.5 = $<<18*.5=9.00>>9.00
Her overtime pay is 18+9 = $<<18+9=27.00>>27.00
Her base pay is $144.00 per 8-hour shift and she works 5 days and makes 5 * $144 = $<<144*5=720.00>>720.00
Her overtime pay is $27.00 per hour and she works 2 hours of overtime per day and makes 27*2 = $<<27*2=54.00>>54.00 in overtime pay
2 hours of overtime pay for 5 days means she makes 54*5 = $270.00
In 5 days her base pay is $720.00 and she makes $270.00 in overtime pay so she makes $720 + $270 = $<<720+270=990.00>>990.00

In the first group of workers, each produces 6 toys * 10 hours = <<6*10=60>>60 toys over their shift.
This is a total of 60 toys * 2 workers = <<60*2=120>>120 toys.
In the second group of workers, each produces 4 toys * 10 hours = <<4*10=40>>40 toys over their shift.
This is a total of 40 toys * 2 workers = <<40*2=80>>80 toys.
Together, these two groups produce 120 + 80 = <<120+80=200>>200 toys.
If the order is still short, then all the workers combined have produced 400 ordered toys – 20 remaining toys = <<400-20=380>>380 toys.
This means the fifth worker produced 380 – 200 = <<380-200=180>>180 toys in total.
The fifth worker therefore produced 180 toys / 10 hours = <<180/10=18>>18 toys per hour.

Let X be the price of a child ticket.
So the price of an adult ticket is X*2.
We know from the problem that 400*X*2 + 200*X = 16,000.
After multiplying, we have 800*X+ 200*X = 16,000.
Combining like terms, we have 1000* X = 16,000.
Dividing both sides by 1000, we have X = $16.
The price of an adult ticket is $16 * 2 = $<<16*2=32>>32.

First, find the total number of blocks south Janet is from her starting point by subtracting the blocks she walked north from the blocks she walked south: 8 blocks - 3 blocks = <<8-3=5>>5 blocks
Then find the number blocks she walked west: 3 blocks * 7 = <<3*7=21>>21 blocks
Then find the number of blocks she walked east: 8 blocks * 2 = <<8*2=16>>16 blocks
Subtract the number of blocks she walked east from the number of blocks she walked west to find how many blocks west of her starting point she is: 21 blocks - 16 blocks = <<21-16=5>>5 blocks
Add the number of blocks she needs to walk north to the number of blocks she needs to walk east: 5 blocks + 5 blocks = <<5+5=10>>10 blocks
Finally, divide the distance she needs to walk by her speed to find how long she'll spend walking: 10 blocks / 2 blocks/minute = <<10/2=5>>5 minutes

Jack is able to carry two 5-gallon buckets of water per trip, or 2 * 5 = 10 gallons of water. Jill can only carry one bucket per trip, or 5 gallons.
Jack completes 3 trips to the well and back for every 2 trips Jill completes, so in that time they have both together carried 3 Jack trips * 2 buckets per Jack trip * 5 gallons per bucket + 2 Jill trips * 1 bucket per Jill trip * 5 gallons per bucket = 30 gallons + 10 gallons = <<3*2*5+2*1*5=40>>40 gallons of water.
If you consider these as a single "group" of trips, it will take 600 gallons / 40 gallons per "group" of trips = <<600/40=15>>15 groups of trips.
As each of these "groups" of trips consists of two Jill trips, Jill will make 15 * 2 = <<15*2=30>>30 trips to the well and back before the tank is filled.

Then, 15% of the new price is $1320 x 15/100 = $<<1320*15/100=198>>198.
So, the final price is now $1320 - $198 = $<<1320-198=1122>>1122.
Therefore, the final price is $1200 - $1122 = $<<1200-1122=78>>78 lower than the original price.

First, we need to determine how many hours Jill studied in total. To find this out, we begin by performing 2*2= <<2*2=4>>4 hours spent on day two, double what she spent on day 1.
Next, we perform 4-1= <<4-1=3>>3 hours to determine the amount she studied on the third day.
We then add 2+4+3= <<2+4+3=9>>9 hours spent in total across 3 days.
Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, she studied 9*60=<<9*60=540>>540 minutes in total.

If Val currently has 20 nickels and finds twice as many nickels as she has in her older brother's treasure box, she will have 2*20=40 more nickels.
The total number of nickels she'll have is 40+20=<<40+20=60>>60
Since nickel is worth $0.05, the value of the nickels Val is having is 60*0.05=$<<60*0.05=3>>3
Val had three times as many dimes as nickels before she found the 40 new nickels, a total of 3*20=<<3*20=60>>60 dimes
Since a dime has a value of $0.10, the value of the dimes that Val has is 60*$0.10=$<<60*0.10=6>>6
Together, the value of the dimes and nickels Val has is worth $6+$3=$<<6+3=9>>9
#### 9

Antonia buys 5 different supplements where 3 bottles have 120 pills per bottle, so she has 120 pills x 3 bottles = 360 pills.
2 of the bottles Antonia buys have 30 pills each x 2 bottles = <<30*2=60>>60 pills.
She has purchased 360 pills + 60 pills = <<360+60=420>>420 pills total in the 5 bottles.
Antonia has filled her 7-day pill box for 2 weeks, so 7 days x 2 weeks = <<7*2=14>>14 days.
On each of the 14 days she fills it with 5 pills, so after 14 days she has used 14 x 5 = <<14*5=70>>70 pills.
Since Antonia had 420 total pills in all 5 bottles and then she fills her pillbox with 70 pills, she has 420 - 70 = <<420-70=350>>350 pills.
Antonia will have 350 pills left after 2 weeks.

If 1/4 inch on the map represents 8 miles on real land, 1 inch represents 4 * 8 = 32 miles.
Since 1 inch represents 32 miles, 3 inches represent 3 * 32 = <<3*32=96>>96 miles.
1/ 4 inch represents 8 miles, 1/8 inch represents 8 / 2 = <<8/2=4>>4 miles because 1/8 is half of 1/4.
If 1/8 inch represents 4 miles, 3/8 of an inch represents 3 * 4 = 12 miles.
This means 3 3/8 inches on the map translate to 96 + 12 = 108 miles.

The total age for the three friends is 40*3 = <<40*3=120>>120
If Molly's age is 30, then Jared and Hakimi have a total age of 120-30 = 90.
Let's say the age of Hakimi is x.
Since Jared is 10 years older than Hakimi, Jared is x+10 years old.
Jared and Hakimi's total age is x+(x+10) = 90
This translates to 2x=90-10
2x=80
Hakimi's age is x=80/2
This gives us x=<<40=40>>40, which is Hamkimi's age.

First figure out how many liters of water are left in the pool when it's 80% full: 2000L * .8 = <<2000*.8=1600>>1600 L
Now subtract that amount from the pool's total capacity to find how much water can splash out before Jim has to refill it: 2000 L - 1600 L = <<2000-1600=400>>400 L
Now multiply that amount by 1000 to convert it to milliliters: 400 L * 1000 ml/L = <<400*1000=400000>>400,000 ml
Finally, divide that amount by the amount that splashes out with each jump to find the number of jumps before pool cleaning: 400,000 ml / 400 ml/jump = <<400000/400=1000>>1000 jumps

Mr. Grey had a $100 000 x 10/100 = $<<100000*10/100=10000>>10,000 profit.
So, Mr. Grey sold the house to Mr. Brown for $100 000 + $10 000 = $<<100000+10000=110000>>110,000.
Mr. Brown sold the house $110 000 x 10/100 = $<<110000*10/100=11000>>11,000 less than its purchased price.
Thus, Mr. Brown sold it for $110 000 - $11 000 = $99,000 to his friend.

If we let X represent the number of pounds of coal that the blue boxcar can hold, then 4000=(1/2)X.
Solving for X, we get X=<<8000=8000>>8000 pounds of coal, which represents what the blue car can hold.
Thus, the red boxcar can hold 3*8000=<<3*8000=24000>>24,000 pounds of coal.
3 red boxcars can carry 3*24,000=<<3*24000=72000>>72,000 pounds of coal.

It takes Lara 7 minutes and 23 seconds to make it through the obstacle course the first time. 7 minutes x 60 seconds per minute = 420 seconds + 23 seconds = <<7*60+23=443>>443 seconds to get through the first part of the obstacle course.
The second stage of the obstacle course she completes in 73 seconds + 443 seconds = <<73+443=516>>516 seconds.
It takes 5 minutes and 58 seconds for Lara to get through the obstacle course the second time. 5 minutes x 60 seconds per minute = 300 + 58 seconds = <<300+58=358>>358 seconds.
Combined, it takes Lara 516 + 358 seconds = <<516+358=874>>874 seconds for Lara to run the whole obstacle course.
#### 874

Ivan has 50 x 10 = <<50*10=500>>500 cents from the 50 dimes in his one piggy bank.

One-tenth of the time, no one reappears, so there have been 100 / 10 = <<100/10=10>>10 times no one has reappeared.
One-fifth of the time, two people reappear, so there have been 100 / 5 = <<100/5=20>>20 times 2 people have reappeared.
In those 20 times, 2 * 20 = <<2*20=40>>40 people have reappeared in all.
Thus, there have been 100 - 10 - 20 = <<100-10-20=70>>70 times one person has reappeared.
Therefore, over 100 acts, 70 + 40 = 100 people have reappeared in all.

First multiply the number of running time-outs by 5: 5 time-outs * 5 = <<5*5=25>>25 time-outs
Then subtract 1 from that number to find the number of food-throwing time-outs: 25 time-outs - 1 = <<25-1=24>>24 time-outs
Then divide that number by 3 to find the number of swearing time-outs: 24 time-outs / 3 = <<24/3=8>>8 time-outs
Then add the number of each kind of time-out to find the total number: 8 time-outs + 24 time-outs + 5 time-outs = <<8+24+5=37>>37 time-outs
Then multiply that number by the length of each time-out to find the total time the students spend in time-out: 37 time-outs * 5 minutes/time-out = <<37*5=185>>185 minutes

The cost of the passion fruit is 2*6=$<<2*6=12>>12
The jackfruit cost 1.5*8=$<<1.5*8=12>>12
The honey is 2*10=$<<2*10=20>>20
So the total cost for a jar is 12+12+20=$<<12+12+20=44>>44
So the profit per jar is 50-44=$<<50-44=6>>6
So the total profit for 10 jars is 10*6=$<<10*6=60>>60
#### 60

The 2 players are sold for a total of 2*10 = $<<2*10=20>>20 million

By the first two months, 20/100*200 = <<20/100*200=40>>40 mountains had erupted.
The total number of mountains remaining after the first round of explosions is 200-40= <<200-40=160>>160
When 40% of the remaining mountains exploded, the number of mountains that were still intact decreased by 40/100*160 = <<40/100*160=64>>64
The number of mountains that hadn't exploded after the second explosions is 160-64 = <<160-64=96>>96
When 50% of the mountains which were still intact exploded, the number of mountains that hadn't erupted was reduced by 50/100*96 = <<50/100*96=48>>48
At the end of the year, 96-48 = <<96-48=48>>48 mountains remained intact and hadn't exploded.

Let e be the number of emails Mindy has and m be the number of phone messages? We know that e + m = 93 and e = 9m - 7.
Substituting the second equation into the first equation, we get 9m - 7 + m = 93
Combining like terms, we get 10m - 7 = 93
Adding 7 to both sides of the equation, we get 10m = 100
Dividing both sides by 10, we get m = <<10=10>>10
Substituting this value back into the equation e = 9m - 7, we get e = 9 * 10 - 7 = 90 - 7 = 83

First calculate how much Jenna spends on salaries: $2,500 * 4 = $<<2500*4=10000>>10,000
Next find Jenna's total fixed costs by adding the cost of salaries and rent: $10,000 + $10,000 = $<<10000+10000=20000>>20,000
Next calculate how much profit Jenna makes on each widget by subtracting the cost from the sale price: $8 - $3 = $<<8-3=5>>5
Now multiply the profit per widget by the number of widgets sold: $5 * 5000 = $<<5*5000=25000>>25,000
Now subtract Jenna's costs from her sales to find her total profit before taxes: $25,000 - $20,000 = $<<25000-20000=5000>>5,000
Now multiply Jenna's profit by her 20% tax rate to find how much she owe in taxes: $5,000 * .2 = $<<5000*.2=1000>>1,000
Now subtract Jenna's taxes from her profit before taxes to find her total profit: $5,000 - $1,000 = $<<5000-1000=4000>>4,000

Let b be the number of trips Bill makes and j be the number Jean makes. We know that b + j = 40, and j = b + 6.
Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get b + b + 6 = 40
Combining like terms, we get 2b + 6 = 40
Subtracting 6 from both sides, we get 2b = 34
Dividing both sides by 2, we get b = 17
Substituting that value back into j = b + 6, we get j = 17 + 6 = <<17+6=23>>23

First find the total amount of water Violet and her dog consume per hour: 800 ml + 400 ml = <<800+400=1200>>1200 ml
Then divide that amount by 1000 ml/L to convert it to liters: 1200 ml / 1000 ml/L = <<1200/1000=1.2>>1.2 L
Then divide Violet's carrying capacity by the amount of water they drink per hour to find how many hours she can hike: 4.8 L / 1.2 L/hour = 4 hours

First, we need to find out which fruit is cheaper individually. We start by figuring out the price for a single apple by performing 200/10= <<200/10=20>>20 cents per apple.
Then we find out the price of an individual orange, by performing 150/5=<<150/5=30>>30 cents per orange.
Since 20<30, the apples are cheaper.
To determine the answer, we multiply 20*12= <<20*12=240>>240 cents
#### 240

The number of microphones that were not able to find space on the stage is 20/100*50 = <<20/100*50=10>>10
This means the singer could set 50-10 = <<50-10=40>>40 microphones into pairs on the stage.
Since a pair has 2 microphones, the singer set up 40/2 = <<40/2=20>>20 pairs of microphones on the stage.

In the bottom half of the igloo, there are 10 rows / 2 = <<10/2=5>>5 rows of bricks of snow.
So in the bottom half of the igloo, there are 5 rows * 12 bricks of snow in each row = <<5*12=60>>60 bricks of snow.
In the top half of the igloo, there are 5 rows * 8 bricks of snow in each row = <<5*8=40>>40 bricks of snow.
There is therefore a total of 60 + 40 = <<60+40=100>>100 bricks of snow in the igloo.
#### 100

First find the probability Jerry gets a blue egg with 5 pieces of candy by multiplying the independent probabilities: 4/5 * 1/4 = 1/5 = 20%
Then find the probability he gets a purple egg with 5 pieces of candy the same way: 1/5 * 1/2 = 1/10 = 10%
Then add the probabilities of the two possible ways to get 5 pieces of candy to find the total probability: 20% + 10% = 30%

#### 23

The salesman sold 17 bags for 17 bags x $18/bag = $<<17*18=306>>306
He sold 10 more for 10 bags x $25/bag = $<<10*25=250>>250
Thus far he has sold 17 bags + 10 bags = <<17+10=27>>27 bags
Therefore he sold 48 bags - 27 bags = <<48-27=21>>21 bags for $22 each
21 bags were sold for 21 bags x $22/bag = $<<21*22=462>>462
In total the salesman made $306 + $250 + $462 = $<<306+250+462=1018>>1018
The salesman made $1018 - $576 = $<<1018-576=442>>442 in profit.

Let x = the total number of candies Corey has.
x + 8 = the total number of candies Tapanga has.
The equation for the total number of candies is x + (x + 8) = 66
Combining like terms, we get 2x + 8 = 66
Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get 2x = 58
Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = <<29=29>>29, so Corey has 29 candies.

First find the number of multiple-choice questions Amy gets right: 80% * 10 questions = <<80*.01*10=8>>8 questions
Then find the number of true/false questions she gets right: 90% * 20 questions = <<90*.01*20=18>>18 questions
Now add those two numbers to find the number of 1-point questions she answered correctly: 8 questions + 18 questions = <<8+18=26>>26 questions. This is also the number of points she got, since each question is worth 1 point.
Now find the number of 5-point questions Amy answered correctly: 5 questions * 60% = <<5*60*.01=3>>3 questions
Now multiply that number by the number of points per question: 3 questions * 5 points/question = <<3*5=15>>15 points
Now add the points from the 1-point and 5-point questions: 26 points + 15 points = <<26+15=41>>41 points

Since a dozen is equal to 12, then 3 dozen eggs are equal to 12 x 3 = <<3*12=36>>36 eggs.
Tricia will use 36 x 1/4 = <<36*1/4=9>>9 eggs for making crepes.
So there are 36 - 9 = <<36-9=27>>27 eggs left.
27 x 2/3 = <<27*2/3=18>>18 eggs will be used for making cupcakes.
Thus, there are only 27 - 18 = <<27-18=9>>9 eggs left to make sunny-side-up eggs for breakfast.

One cheesecake was 30% cheaper than the apple pie, which means, it was 25/100 * 12 = $3 cheaper.
So for one cheesecake, Natalie needed to pay 12 - 3 = $<<12-3=9>>9.
The six-pack of muffins was two times more expensive than the cheesecake, which means its price was 9 * 2 = $<<9*2=18>>18.
So for two cheesecakes, Natalie paid also 9 * 2 = $<<9*2=18>>18.
So for all her shopping she paid 18 + 18 + 12 = $<<18+18+12=48>>48.

Each kettle has 15 hawks that get pregnant and each one yields 4 babies per pregnancy so there are 15 * 4= <<15*4=60>>60 babies expected per kettle.
If 60 baby hawks are expected per kettle and the ornithologists are tracking 6 kettles total then there are 60 * 6=<<60*6=360>>360 baby hawks expected across all six kettles this breeding season.
If there 25% of eggs do not hatch, then we are looking for 25 (percent that do not make it) /100 (total number of babies expected)=<<25/100=.25>>.25 (percentage converted to decimal form for the proportion of expected baby hawks to be lost).
The total number of baby hawks expected equals 360 * .25 expected los s= <<360*.25=90>>90 babies not expected to hatch (lost).
There are 360 total number of baby hawks expected and there are 90 babies expected to be lost so 360-90= <<360-90=270>>270 remaining baby hawks expected this breeding season
