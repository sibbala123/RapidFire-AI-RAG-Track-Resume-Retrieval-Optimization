In the trucks, James saw 12 * 2 = <<12*2=24>>24 people.
In the buses, he saw 2 * 15 = <<2*15=30>>30 people.
He saw 2 * 2 = <<2*2=4>>4 taxis go past him.
Therefore, he saw 4 * 2 = <<4*2=8>>8 people in the taxis.
In the cars, he saw 30 * 3 = <<30*3=90>>90 people.
Since we know how many vehicles James saw in total, we know that he saw 52 – 12 – 2 – 4 – 30 = <<52-12-2-4-30=4>>4 motorbikes.
So, he saw 4 * 1 = <<4*1=4>>4 people on motorbikes.
He has therefore seen a total of 24 + 30 + 8 + 90 + 4 = <<24+30+8+90+4=156>>156 people.

First find how many giraffe statues Nancy can make by dividing the total amount of jade by the amount used per giraffe statue: 1920 g / 120 g/giraffe = <<1920/120=16>>16 giraffes
Then multiply that number by the price per giraffe to find how much Nancy earns total from giraffes: 16 giraffes * $150/giraffe = $<<16*150=2400>>2400
Then find how much jade each elephant statue uses by doubling the jade used by the giraffe statues: 120 g/giraffe * 2 = <<120*2=240>>240 g/elephant
Then find how many elephant statues Nancy can make by dividing the total amount of jade by the amount used per elephant statue: 1920 g / 240 g/elephant = <<1920/240=8>>8 elephant
Multiply that number by the price per elephant to find Nancy's total earnings from elephants: 8 elephants * $350/elephant = $<<8*350=2800>>2800
Finally, subtract Nancy's total earnings from the giraffes from her total earnings from the elephants to find the difference: $2800 - $2400 = $<<2800-2400=400>>400

It will be easy to solve the problem by first calculating how much money she makes in a week at her job by multiplying her hourly rate by the number of hours she works in a week: $8 * 35 = $<<8*35=280>>280 in a week
The weekly earnings need to be multiplied by the number of weeks in a month to get how much she made in a month: $280 * 4 = $<<280*4=1120>>1120
The bike’s cost must be subtracted from her earnings made in a month to get how much money is left over after purchasing the bike: $1120 - $400 = $<<1120-400=720>>720 is left over after purchasing her bike

First find the total number of hours Brendan works for the 8-hour shifts: 2 shifts * 8 hours/shift = <<2*8=16>>16 hours
Then find the total number of hours Brendan works by adding those hours to the 12-hour shift: 16 hours + 12 hours = <<16+12=28>>28 hours
Now find Brendan's total wage earnings by multiplying his $6/hour wage by the number of hours he works: $6/hour * 28 hours = $<<6*28=168>>168/week
Now figure out how much Brendan makes in tips by multiplying the number of hours he works by the amount of tips he makes per hour: $12/hour * 28 hours/week = $<<12*28=336>>336/week
Now divide that number by 3, since Brendan only reports a third of his tips: $336/week / 3 = $<<336/3=112>>112/week
Now add Brendan's wage earnings to that number to find how much income he reports to the IRS each week: $168/week + $112/week = $<<168+112=280>>280/week
Finally, multiply Brendan's reported income by his tax rate to find how much he pays in taxes each week: $280/week * .2 = $<<280*.2=56>>56/week

The season is broken up into 22/2=<<22/2=11>>11 episode based on cost
The first 11 episodes cost 11*1000=$<<11*1000=11000>>11,000
The next set of episodes cost 1000*1.2=$<<1000*1.2=1200>>1200 more per episode
So they cost 1000+1200=$<<1000+1200=2200>>2200 each
So in total they cost 2200*11=$<<2200*11=24200>>24200
So in total the season cost 24200+11000=$<<24200+11000=35200>>35,200

Let x be the number of camels.
Since each animal has one head, the number of dromedaries is 180 - x.
Each camel has two humps and each dromedary has one hump so in total there are 2x + 180 – x = 304 humps.
x = 304 – 180
x = <<124=124>>124
So, there are 124 camels and 180 – 124 = 56 dromedaries.

Two kilograms of sugar is priced at $1.50 x 2 = $<<2*1.5=3>>3.
Three kilograms of sugar is priced at $1.50 x 3 = $<<3*1.5=4.50>>4.50.
So five kilograms of salt is priced at $5.50 - $3 = $2.50.
Thus, a kilogram of salt is priced at $2.50/5 = $<<2.5/5=0.50>>0.50.
Hence, three kilograms of sugar and a kilogram of salt.s price is $4.50 + $0.50 = $5.

First find how much water fills the bathtub per hour: 40 ml/minute * 60 minutes/hour = <<40*60=2400>>2400 ml/hour
Then subtract the water that evaporates to find the total amount of water added per hour: 2400 ml/hour - 200 ml/hour = <<2400-200=2200>>2200 ml/hour
Then multiply that amount by the number of hours to find the total amount of water in the tub: 2200 ml/hour * 9 hours = <<2200*9=19800>>19800 ml
Then find the number of milliliters in 12 liters: 12 liters * 1000 ml/liter = <<12*1000=12000>>12000 ml
Then subtract the water Jack removes from the total amount of water to find the remaining amount of water: 19800 ml - 12000 ml = <<19800-12000=7800>>7800 ml
#### 7800

Some of the pool floats were damaged, which means that 120 / 4 = <<120/4=30>>30 pool floats were discarded.
This left the class with 120 – 30 = <<120-30=90>>90 pool floats that were actually part of the donations they need to organize.
This means there were a total of 60 basketball hoops + 90 pool floats + 50 footballs + 40 tennis balls = <<60+90+50+40=240>>240 donations that were not basketballs.
So out of the donations, there were 300 donations – 240 = <<300-240=60>>60 basketballs.
In addition, half of the basketball hoops were donated with a basketball included which amounts to 60 basketball hoops / 2 = <<60/2=30>>30 basketballs.
There was therefore a total of 60 + 30 = <<60+30=90>>90 basketballs donated.

Let X be the amount Susan had originally. Susan spent 1/5*X in September, 1/4*X in October, and $120 in November.
Susan has X - 1/5*X - 1/4*X - $120 = $540 left.
Combining like terms, we get 11/20*X - $120 = $540
Adding $120 to both sides, we get 11/20*X = $660.
Dividing both sides by 11/20 we get X = $1200.

First figure out how many square feet a wall in the living room is: 40 feet length * 10 feet height = <<40*10=400>>400 square feet
Now multiply by 3 since Matt needs to paint three living room walls: 400 square feet/wall * 3 walls = <<400*3=1200>>1200 square feet
Next figure out how many square feet the long walls in the bedroom are: 12 feet * 10 feet = <<12*10=120>>120 square feet
There are two long walls, so multiply this figure by 2: 120 square feet/wall * 2 walls = <<120*2=240>>240 square feet
Next figure out how many square feet the short walls in the bedroom are: 10 feet * 10 feet = <<10*10=100>>100 square feet
Multiply this by 2, since there are two short walls: 100 square feet/wall * 2 walls = <<100*2=200>>200 square feet
Finally, add up the square footage from the three living room walls, the two short bedroom walls, and the two long bedroom walls: 1200 square feet + 240 square feet + 200 square feet = <<1200+240+200=1640>>1640 square feet

First figure out how many apples total are needed for one pint of cider: 20 golden delicious/pint + 40 pink lady/pint = <<20+40=60>>60 apples/pint
Then multiply that number by 8 to find the number of apples needed for a gallon of cider: 60 apples/pint * 8 pints/gallon = <<60*8=480>>480 apples/gallon
Now find how many apples per hour all 8 farmhands pick: 240 apples/hour/farmhand * 6 farmhands = <<240*6=1440>>1440 apples/hour
Then multiply that amount by the number of hours worked to find the total number of apples gathered: 1440 apples/hour * 5 hours = <<1440*5=7200>>7200 apples
Divide the total number of apples gathered by the number of apples used by gallon to find the number of gallons of cider made: 7200 apples / 480 apples/gallon = <<7200/480=15>>15 gallons
Since there are 8 pints in a gallon, the final answer is 15 gallons * 8 pints / gallon = <<15*8=120>>120 pints

Throughout the 30 minutes, Kris blows up 2 balloons per minute * 30 minutes = <<2*30=60>>60 balloons.
Her brother works at double Kris' speed in the first 15 minutes so he works at 2 balloons per minute * 2 = <<2*2=4>>4 balloons per minute.
So in the first 15 minutes, he blows up 4 balloons per minute * 15 minutes = <<4*15=60>>60 balloons.
In the second 15 minutes, he is working at double the rate he did previously, so he blows up 4 balloons per minute * 2 = <<4*2=8>>8 balloons per minute.
In the second 15 minutes, Kris’ brother therefore blows up 8 balloons per minute * 15 minutes = <<8*15=120>>120 balloons.
Throughout the 30 minutes, he has blown up a total of 60 + 120 = <<60+120=180>>180 balloons.
Kris and her brother therefore blew up a total of 60 balloons from Kris + 180 balloons from Kris’ brother = <<60+180=240>>240 balloons.

First find the total lost revenue if Jackie does her taxes herself: $35/hour * 3 hours = $<<35*3=105>>105
Then subtract the accountant's charge to find how much money Janet saves: $105 - $90 = $<<105-90=15>>15
#### 15

Tom will be 30 in 5 years so now he is 30-5 = <<30-5=25>>25
2 years ago Tom was 25-2 = <<25-2=23>>23
At that time, Jared was twice as old as Tom so Jared was 23*2 = 46
Two years have since passed so Jared is now 46+2 = <<46+2=48>>48
#### 48

Cody needs to read 54 books - 6 books - 3 books = <<54-6-3=45>>45 books.
Cody read 9 books each week after = 45 books / 9 books per week = <<45/9=5>>5 weeks.
Cody read for 1 week + 1 week + 5 weeks = <<1+1+5=7>>7 weeks total.
#### 7

First subtract $500 from Karen's goal bonus amount to find how much she makes from the extra $10/point bonus: $600 - $500 = $<<600-500=100>>100
Then divide the extra bonus by the extra rate: $100 / $10/point = <<100/10=10>>10 points
Then add the 10 extra points to the baseline 75 point goal to find the students' average test score: 10 points + 75 points = <<10+75=85>>85 points
Then added the 8 graded tests to the 2 ungraded tests to find the total number of tests: 2 tests + 8 tests = <<2+8=10>>10 tests
Then multiply the 85 point average by the number of tests to find the total number of points the students need to earn: 85 points/test * 10 tests = 850 points
Then multiply the current average by the current number of graded tests to find how many points have been earned so far: 70 points/test * 8 tests = <<70*8=560>>560 points
Then subtract the number of points earned from the number of points needed to find the combine score the last two tests need: 850 points - 560 points = <<850-560=290>>290 points
#### 290

If there are 40 people, each person gets 600/40 = <<600/40=15>>15 cans.
Thirty percent of the total number of people present is 30/100*40 = <<30/100*40=12>>12
If there are 30% fewer people, the number of people who are to be fed is 40-12 = <<40-12=28>>28
Since each person is given 15 cans, twenty-eight people will need 15*28 = <<15*28=420>>420 cans.
#### 420

Ted spent a total of 3*16 = <<3*16=48>>48 dollars on books.
Ted spent a total of 3*6 = <<3*6=18>>18 dollars on pencils.

There were 21 - 7 = <<21-7=14>>14 buttons with four holes.
The four-holed buttons had 14 * 4 = <<14*4=56>>56 holes.
The two-holed buttons had 7 * 2 = <<7*2=14>>14 holes.
Thus, there were 56 + 14 = <<56+14=70>>70 holes in all the buttons in the bag.
#### 70

If each movie ticket is sold at $30, the cost of buying eight movie tickets is 8*$30 = $<<8*30=240>>240
Since eight movie tickets cost 2 times as much as one football game ticket, the cost of buying one football game ticket is $240/2 = $<<240/2=120>>120
Buying five football game tickets will cost 5*$120 = $<<5*120=600>>600
The total cost of buying eight movie tickets and five football game tickets is $600+$240 = $840
#### 840

Tom picked 12 x 2 = <<12*2=24>>24 apples

If a bunny comes out of its hole three times in a minute, in an hour, with 60 minutes, the bunny will come out of the hole 60*3=<<60*3=180>>180 times.
In 10 hours, a bunny will come out of their hole 180*10=<<180*10=1800>>1800 times.
The combined time that 20 bunnies coming out of their holes will have taken in 10 hours is 1800*20=<<1800*20=36000>>36000 times.
#### 36000

Peter wants 12 * 1/4 = <<12*1/4=3>>3 kg of apples.
Paul wants 12 * 1/3 = <<12*1/3=4>>4 kg of apples.
Together, Peter and Paul want a total of 3 + 4 = <<3+4=7>>7 kg of apples.
So James will have 12 - 7 = <<12-7=5>>5 kg.
#### 5

1/6 * 240 students = <<1/6*240=40>>40 students. So 40 students read three or more novels.
35/100 * 240 students = <<35/100*240=84>>84 students. So 84 students read two novels.
5/12 * 240 students = <<5/12*240=100>>100 students. So 100 students read a novel.
240 students – (40 students + 84 students + 100 students) = 240 students – 224 students = <<240-(40+84+100)=16>>16 students. So 16 students don't read novels.
#### 16

Before the Wednesday discount, the cost of the jean is $14.50 + $10.00 = $<<14.5+10=24.50>>24.50.
Since the original price was reduced by 50%, the original cost for the jeans is $24.50 * 2 = $<<24.5*2=49.00>>49.00.
#### 49

Removing the time of the train ride from the journey shows that his trip to get on the train took him 8 hours – 6 hours = <<8-6=2>>2 hours.
Converting this time into minutes shows that getting to the train took 2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = <<2*60=120>>120 minutes.
Waiting for the train to arrive took twice as long as his walk, so 15 minutes * 2 = <<15*2=30>>30 minutes.
This means that his bus ride must have taken 120 minutes – 30 minutes - 15 minutes = <<120-30-15=75>>75 minutes.
#### 75

The bulk warehouse has 48 cans for $12.00 so that's 12/48 = $0.25 a can
The local grocery store has 12 cans for $6.00 so that's 6/12 = $0.50 a can
The grocery store offer is $0.50 a can and the warehouse is $0.25 a can so the grocery store is .50-.25 = $<<0.50-.25=0.25>>0.25 more expensive per can
#### 25

She orders 2 sandwiches that are $7.75 so they cost 2*$7.75 = $<<2*7.75=15.50>>15.50
The brie is three times more expensive than the $4.00 salami so the brie costs 3*$4 = $<<3*4=12.00>>12.00
She buys 1/4 pound of the olives that costs $10.00 a pound so they cost .25*$10 =$<<1/4*10=2.50>>2.50
She buys 1/2 pound of feta that costs $8.00 a pound so it costs .5*$8 = $<<1/2*8=4.00>>4.00
The salami is $4.00, the brie is $12.00, olives are $2.50 and the feta is $4.00 and the sandwiches are $15.50 for a total of $4+$12+$2.50+$4+$15.50 = $<<4+12+2.5+4+15.50=38.00>>38.00
Adding the french bread gives $38.00+$2.00 = $<<38+2=40>>40
#### 40

Rachel spends 1 + 1 = <<1+1=2>>2 hours setting up and cleaning up.
She paints for 1 hour x 4 paintings = <<1*4=4>>4 hours.
Then she edits 1.5 hours x 4 videos = <<1.5*4=6>>6 hours.
She spends 2 + 4 + 6 = <<2+4+6=12>>12 hours to make 4 videos.
So Rachel spends 12 / 4 = <<12/4=3>>3 hours on each video.
#### 3

Since a year has 365 days, the total television production in the first year is 10*365 = <<10*365=3650>>3650
In the second year, they reduced the total television production by 10/100*3650 = <<10/100*3650=365>>365
The total television production in the second year was 3650-365 = <<3650-365=3285>>3285.
#### 3285

Twenty bottles of oil is equal to 200 mL x 20 = <<20*200=4000>>4000 mL.

#### 4

If Pedro has three times more gumballs than Alicia, he has 3 * 20 gumballs = <<3*20=60>>60 gumballs more
In total, Pedro has 20 gumballs + 60 gumballs = <<20+60=80>>80 gumballs
When they put their gumballs together, the total number of gumballs in the bowl becomes 20 gumballs + 80 gumballs = <<20+80=100>>100 gumballs
Pedro takes out 40% of the gumballs which is 40/100 * 100 gumballs = <<40/100*100=40>>40 gumballs.
The number of gumballs remaining is 100 gumballs - 40 gumballs = <<100-40=60>>60 gumballs
#### 60

First find how many gigabytes are in 40% of the file: 200 GB * 40% = <<200*40*.01=80>>80 GB
Then divide that number by the download rate to find the time until Windows restarts: 80 GB / 2 GB/minute = <<80/2=40>>40 minutes
Then find the time to download the whole file after the restart: 200 GB / 2 GB/minute = <<200/2=100>>100 minutes
Then add the time to download 40% of the file, to download the whole file, and to wait for Windows to update: 40 minutes + 100 minutes + 20 minutes = <<40+100+20=160>>160 minutes

The actual initial inventory of Samsung cell phones was 14, but there were 2 defective phones so 14 - 2 = <<14-2=12>>12 is the initial inventory of working Samsung phones.
The actual initial inventory of iPhone cell phones was 8, but there was one defective phone, so 8 - 1 = <<8-1=7>>7 is the actual initial inventory of working iPhones.
Thus only 12 - 10 = <<12-10=2>>2 Samsung cell phones were sold.
Thus only 7 - 5 = <<7-5=2>>2 iPhones were sold.
Thus the total number of phones sold is 2 Samsung + 2 iPhone = <<2+2=4>>4 cell phones.

Thomas has been saving for six years, and since each year has 12 months, he has been making savings for 6*12 = <<6*12=72>>72 months.
Since Thomas has been saving $40 in the bank every month for six years, he has saved 72*$40 = $<<72*40=2880>>2880
Joseph has been saving 2/5 times less money per month than Thomas, meaning he has been saving 2/5*$40 = $<<2/5*40=16>>16 less per month.
The total amount of money that Joseph has been saving per month is $40-$16 = $<<40-16=24>>24
In six years, Joseph has saved $24*72 = $<<24*72=1728>>1728

Rica is left with 1 - 1/5 = 4/5 of her prize money which is equal to $300.
Since 4/5 is worth $300, then 1/5 is worth $300/4 = $75.
So, Rica got $75 x 5 = $375 from their prize money which is 3/8 of the total prize.
Since 3/8 is equal to $375, then 1/8 is worth $375/3 = $125.
So, the total prize money is $125 x 8 = $<<125*8=1000>>1000.

So, she saw 9 + 1 = <<9+1=10>>10 sparrows.
Therefore, Camille saw 3 + 12 + 6 + 10 = <<3+12+6+10=31>>31 birds.
#### 31

He drinks 16/4=<<16/4=4>>4 of the small bottles each day
That is 4*16=<<4*16=64>>64 ounces
The larger bottles are 16*.25=<<16*.25=4>>4 ounces larger
So the large bottles are 16+4=<<16+4=20>>20 ounces
So he drinks 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 ounces of those a day
So he drinks 64+40=<<64+40=104>>104 ounces a day
That means he drinks 104*7=<<104*7=728>>728 ounces a day

If Brian caught 400 fish in one trip, he caught 2*400=<<400*2=800>>800 fish in two trips.
Since Brian catches 2/5 times less fish than Chris per trip, Chris catches 2/5*400=<<2/5*400=160>>160 more fish in one fishing trip.
Chris's total number of fish in one trip is 400+160 = <<400+160=560>>560 fish.
In 10 trips, Chris catches 560*10=<<560*10=5600>>5600 fish.
If in his two trips Brian catches 800 fish, and he goes fishing twice as often as Chris, if Chris goes fishing 10 times, Brian will catch 800*10=<<800*10=8000>>8000 fish.
The total number of fish they'll catch if Chris goes fishing ten times is 8000+5600=<<8000+5600=13600>>13600

The cheap gym cost 10*12=$<<10*12=120>>120 for monthly fees
So the total cost was 120+50=$<<120+50=170>>170
The more expensive gym cost 3*10=$<<3*10=30>>30 per month
That means the sign-up fee was 30*4=$<<30*4=120>>120
The monthly fees for the expensive gym comes out to 30*12=$<<30*12=360>>360 per year
So the total cost for the expensive gym was 360+120=$<<360+120=480>>480
So his total cost was 480+170=$<<480+170=650>>650
#### 650

Nancy has 40 + 20 = <<40+20=60>>60 pearl beads.
So, Nancy has a total of 40 + 60 = <<40+60=100>>100 beads.
Rose has 2 x 20 = <<2*20=40>>40 stone beads.
So, Rose has 20 + 40 = <<20+40=60>>60 beads.
Thus, Nancy and Rose have 100 + 60 = <<100+60=160>>160 beads altogether.
Therefore, they can make 160/8 = <<160/8=20>>20 bracelets.

Jean pays 250*6=$<<250*6=1500>>1500 a day
So he pays 1500*4=$<<1500*4=6000>>6000 a week
So the work cost 6000*5=$<<6000*5=30000>>30,000
They give a discount of 30,000*.1=$<<30000*.1=3000>>3000
So the total cost paid is 30,000-3000=$<<30000-3000=27000>>27,000
#### 27000

50 x 2/5 = <<50*2/5=20>>20 posters are small.
And 50/2 = <<50/2=25>>25 posters are medium.
So 20 + 25 = <<20+25=45>>45 posters are not large.
Therefore, 50 - 45 = <<50-45=5>>5 posters are large.
#### 5

They have raised $174 because 83 plus 91 equals <<83+91=174>>174.

Starting with 6 red socks, twice the number of blue socks as red meant Joseph had 2*6=12 blue socks.
With one less pair of red socks than white socks, this meant 2 fewer red socks than white, for a total of 6-2=<<6-2=4>>4 white socks.
Also, 12 blue socks=6 pairs of blue socks.
With three more pairs of blue socks than pairs of black socks, this means he had 6-3=<<6-3=3>>3 pairs of black socks.
And three pairs of black socks corresponds to 3*2=<<3*2=6>>6 black socks.
Thus, in total, he had 6+12+4+6=<<6+12+4+6=28>>28 socks.
#### 28

Each piece of Rory’s cake weighs 20 ounces / 8 pieces = <<20/8=2.5>>2.5 ounces.
If Rory and her mom each have a slice, they will have eaten 2.5 ounces + 2.5 ounces = <<2.5+2.5=5>>5 ounces.
The rest of the cake weighs 20 ounces – 5 ounces = <<20-5=15>>15 ounces.
