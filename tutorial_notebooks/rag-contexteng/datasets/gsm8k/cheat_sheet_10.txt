During dinner time, Yves and his siblings ate 16/4 = <<16/4=4>>4 slices.
So the next day, there were still 16 - 4 = <<16-4=12>>12 slices left.
The next day, Yves ate 12/4 = <<12/4=3>>3 slices of pizza.
Thus, there were 12 - 3 = <<12-3=9>>9 slices left.
Then, his two siblings ate 2 x 2 = <<2*2=4>>4 slices of pizza.
Therefore, there were still 9 - 4 = <<9-4=5>>5 slices of pizza left.

If Antonella spent $3 and now has $11, that means initially she had $3 + $11 = $<<3+11=14>>14
Let the number of loonies Antonella had be L and the number of toonies be T. Initially she had in her purse a total of 1L + 2T = $14
We also know that she had 10 coins in total or 10=L+T
That means initially she had T=10-L toonies
Combining both equations we know that 14=1L+2*(10-L)
If we multiply through the parentheses, we get 14=1L+20-2L
If we combine the variables on one side and the constants on another, we get -6=-1L or L=6
Knowing the value of L, we can solve for T= 10 - L = 10 - 6 = <<10-6=4>>4

First figure out how many minutes Carson spends at the carnival by multiplying the number of hours he's there by the number of minutes per hour: 4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = <<4*60=240>>240 minutes
Then figure out how long Carson spends waiting for the roller coaster by multiplying the wait time per ride by the number of rides: 4 rides * 30 minutes/ride = <<4*30=120>>120 minutes
Now subtract the time Carson spends on the roller coaster and tilt-a-whirl from the total time he spends at the park to find out how much time he has left: 240 minutes - 120 minutes - 60 minutes = <<240-120-60=60>>60 minutes
Now divide the time Carson has left by the wait time for the giant slide to see how many times he can ride it: 60 minutes / 15 minutes/ride = <<60/15=4>>4 rides

First, set up the equation for the number of eggs the chickens lay each day: 3r + 5w = 42, where r is the number of red chickens and w is the number of white chickens.
Then, express r in terms of w based on the information in the problem: w = r + <<+2=2>>2
Now substitute r + 2 for w in the equation for the number of eggs: 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42
Now multiply 5 through the parentheses: 3r + 5r + 10 = 42
Now add like terms to get 8r + 10 = 42
Now subtract 10 from both sides of the equation: 8r = 32
Finally, divide both sides of the equation by 8 to get r = 4

The teacher uses 45% of his 5 inch stick of chalk on Monday, or 5 * .45 = <<5*.45=2.25>>2.25 inches.
He is left with 5 - 2.25 = <<5-2.25=2.75>>2.75 inches of chalk.
The next day he will use 20% of 2.75 inches, which is 2.75 * .2 = <<2.75*.2=.55>>.55 inches of chalk used.
That leaves him with 2.75 - .55 = <<2.75-.55=2.2>>2.2 inches of chalk.
The day after that, he will use 2.2 * .2 = <<2.2*.2=.44>>.44 inches of chalk.
That will leave him with 2.2 - .44 = <<2.2-.44=1.76>>1.76 inches of chalk.
Since 1.76 is less than 2 inches, he will recycle this stick in 2 days.

First find the percentage of milk bottles that are fresh: 100% - 20% = 80%
Then find the percentage of the eggs that aren't rotten: 100% - 60% = 40%
Then find the fraction of the flour canisters that don't have weevils: 1 - 1/4 = 3/4
Divide the numerator of this fraction by the denominator and multiply by 100% to convert from a fraction to a percent: 3 / 4 * 100% = 75%
Then multiply the probability that each ingredient is good to find the probability they all are: 75% * 80% * 40% = 24%

A tray of eggs has 30 eggs, so Kelsey brought 2/5*30 = <<30*2/5=12>>12 eggs
On the other hand, Stephanie brought 1/2*30 = <<1/2*30=15>>15 eggs to the party.
The total number of eggs that Kelsey and Stephanie brought to Willa's party is 15+12 =<<15+12=27>>27
Alayah brought 27+40 = <<27+40=67>>67 eggs, 40 more than the number brought by Kelsey and Stephanie combined.
Together with Aliyah's eggs, there were a total of 67+27 = <<67+27=94>>94
Willa also had 2*30 = <<2*30=60>>60 eggs from the two trays she had.
In total, there were 94+60 = <<94+60=154>>154 eggs used at the party.
#### 154

First find the total weight of the soda by multiplying the number of crates by the weight per crate: 20 crates * 50 pounds/crate = <<20*50=1000>>1000 pounds
Then find the weight of the fresh produce by doubling the weight of the soda: 1000 pounds * 2 = <<1000*2=2000>>2000 pounds
Now find the weight of the dryers by multiplying the quantity by the weight per item: 3 dryers * 3000 pounds/dryer = <<3*3000=9000>>9000 pounds
Now add the empty truck's weight to the weight of all three groups of products to find the fully loaded weight: 12000 pounds + 1000 pounds + 2000 pounds + 9000 pounds = <<12000+1000+2000+9000=24000>>24000 pounds

First subtract the cost of Mark's groceries from the amount he gives the cashier to find how much he gets in change: $7.00 - $4.20 - $2.05 = $<<7-4.2-2.05=0.75>>0.75
Then subtract the value of a quarter in cents (25) and the value of a dime in cents (10) from the change amount to find how much Mark gets paid in nickels: $0.75 - $0.25 - $0.10 = $<<0.75-0.25-0.10=0.40>>0.40
Now divide the amount Mark gets in nickels by the value per nickel in cents (5) to find how many nickels Mark gets: $0.40 / $0.05/nickel = <<0.40/0.05=8>>8 nickels
#### 8

Jameson has 5 x 2 = <<5*2=10>>10 medals for swimming.

The sum of the weights of the five boys is 55 kg x 5 = <<55*5=275>>275 kg.
The sum of the weights of the ten students is 225 kg + 275 kg = <<225+275=500>>500 kg.
Hence, the average weight of those ten students is 500 kg/10 = <<500/10=50>>50 kg.
#### 50

Mitch earns 5 x $3 = $<<5*3=15>>15 every weekday.
So, she earns $15 x 5 = $<<15*5=75>>75 from Monday to Friday.
And she earns $3 x 2 = $<<3*2=6>>6 per hour every weekend.
Hence, the total amount she earns every weekend is $6 x 3= $<<6*3=18>>18.
So, she earns $18 x 2 = $<<18*2=36>>36 every Saturday and Sunday.
Therefore, the total amount she earns every week is $75 + $36= $<<75+36=111>>111.
#### 111

The cost of a regularly-priced uniform is $7.50 for the shirt + $15 for pants + $4.50 for socks = $<<7.5+15+4.5=27>>27.
The cost of a discounted uniform is $6.75 for the shirt + $13.50 for pants + $3.75 for socks = $<<6.75+13.5+3.75=24>>24.
By purchasing the discounted uniform, each team member would save $27 for full price - $24 for discounted= $<<27-24=3>>3.
So, for the team of 12, they would save $3 * 12 = $<<3*12=36>>36

First find the total number of vehicles Carmen counted: 50 trucks + 40 cars = <<50+40=90>>90 vehicles
Then find the number of trucks that were red: 50 trucks / 2 = <<50/2=25>>25 trucks
Then find the number of trucks that were black: 50 trucks * .2 = <<50*.2=10>>10 trucks
Then subtract the red and black trucks from the total number of trucks to find the number of white trucks: 50 trucks - 25 trucks - 10 trucks = <<50-25-10=15>>15 trucks
Then divide the number of white trucks by the number of vehicles and multiply by 100% to find the percentage of vehicles that are white trucks: 15 trucks / 90 vehicles * 100% = 16.66...%, which rounds up to 17%.

The jeans cost $40 and are sale for 25% off so 40 * .25 = $<<40*.25=10.00>>10.00 discount
Take the original cost of the jeans and subtract the discount so 40-10 = $<<40-10=30.00>>30.00
Mike pays with a $50 bill and the final cost of the jeans is $30 so 50-30 = $<<50-30=20.00>>20.00 left
#### 20

First, the number of segments in the 2 millipedes that are twice as long is 60 segments * 2 = <<60*2=120>>120 segments.
Then one can multiply the segments by the 2 millipedes to find the total number of segments: 120 segments/millipede * 2 millipedes = <<120*2=240>>240 segments.
In total, we then find the scorpion has eaten one 60-segment millipede in addition to the 3 millipedes above for a total of 60 + 240 = <<60+240=300>>300 segments.
So, the number of segments it still needs to eat are : 800 segments - 300 segments = <<800-300=500>>500 segments
Thus, it needs to eat an additional 500 segments / 50 segments/millipede = <<500/50=10>>10 millipedes.
#### 10

The flashlight was 20% of the price of the hoodie, so 80 * 20/100 = $<<80*20/100=16>>16.
The promotion for a pair of boots was 110 * 10/100 = $<<110*10/100=11>>11.
So the pair of boots cost 110 - 11 = $<<110-11=99>>99.
Celina therefore spent 80 + 16 + 99 = $<<80+16+99=195>>195 on the equipment.
#### 195

The price of the tea was twice the price of the cheese, so the cheese cost was 10 / 2 = $<<10/2=5>>5.
The price of the butter was 80/100 * 5 = $<<80/100*5=4>>4.
If the bread was 2 times cheaper than butter, that means it cost 4 / 2 = $<<4/2=2>>2.
That means Ursula paid for all her shopping 2 + 4 + 5 + 10 = $<<2+4+5+10=21>>21.
#### 21

She stocks one roll in each of the 6 bathrooms, every day of the week so that 6*7 = <<6*7=42>>42 rolls a week
She restocks 42 rolls a week so after 4 weeks that's 42*4 = <<42*4=168>>168 rolls
The bulk toilet paper comes 1 dozen rolls in a pack and she needs 168 rolls so she needs 168/12 = <<168/12=14>>14 dozen
#### 14

Let m be the number of copies Marilyn sold and h be the number Harald sold. We know that m + h = 80,000 and m = 10h.
Substituting the second equation into the first, we get 10h + h = 88,000
Combining like terms, we get 11h = 88,000
Dividing both sides by 11, we get h = 8,000
#### 8000

#### 71

He gets 30% off any book over $22 and he buys books that cost $25.00 and $35.00 so the total cost of these books is $25 + $35 = $<<25+35=60.00>>60.00
At 30% off, the discount on these books is $60*.30 = $<<60*.30=18.00>>18.00
That mean these 2 books will cost $60-$18 = $<<60-18=42.00>>42.00
He gets 20% off any book under $20 and he buys books for $18.00, $12.00 and $10.00 so these books together cost $18 + $12 + $10 = $40.00
at 20% off, the discount on these books is 40*.20 = $8.00
So these 3 books will cost $40 - $8 = $<<40-8=32.00>>32.00
He has spent $42.00 on the two most expensive books, $32.00 on the 3 cheapest books, and also bought a book for $21.00, so his total comes to $42 + $32 + $21 = $<<42+32+21=95.00>>95.00

On Monday Miriam does 5 push-ups + 7 push-ups on Tuesday = <<5+7=12>>12 push-ups on both days.
On Wednesday she does twice as many push-ups as she did on Tuesday, 7 x 2 = <<7*2=14>>14 push-ups on Wednesday.
Over the first 3 days, she did a total of 14 + 12 = <<14+12=26>>26 pushups
On Thursday Miriam did 1/2 the same number of total pushups she had already done that week, so she did 1/2 x 26 = <<1/2*26=13>>13 pushups on Thursday.
On Friday she does as many push-ups as the total of what she had done over the previous four days, so she did 5 + 7 + 14 + 13 = <<5+7+14+13=39>>39 push-ups on Friday.

We are trying to figure out how many times Max won at Mario Kart, so we'll call that number Y.
We know the ratio of Chloe’s wins to Max’s wins is 8/3, so 8/3 = 24/Y.
Next, we will multiply to find the cross-products. 8 x Y = 3 x 24 or 8Y = 72.
We want to get figure out Y, so we need to get it by itself by dividing by 8, like this: 8Y / 8 = 72 / 8.
Y = <<9=9>>9, so Max won 9 times.

From 2pm to 4pm is 4-2=2 hours.
Thus, from 2-4pm, raining at 4 inches per hour, it added 8 inches to the rain gauge.
From 4pm to 7pm is 7-4=<<7-4=3>>3 hours.
Thus, from 4-7pm, raining at a rate of 3 inches per hour, it added 3*3=<<3*3=9>>9 inches to the rain gauge.
From 7pm to 9pm is 9-7=<<9-7=2>>2 hours.
Thus, from 7-9pm, raining at a rate of 0.5 inches per hour, it added 2*0.5=1 inch to the gauge.
If the gauge originally contained 2 inches of water, by 9pm the gauge contained 2+8+9+1=<<2+8+9+1=20>>20 inches of water.

Half the original number of trash cans in Veteran's Park is 24/2=<<24/2=12>>12 trash cans.
Thus Central Park originally had 8 more than half the number of trash cans as what was originally in Veteran's Park, or 12+8=<<8+12=20>>20 trash cans.
Half of the trash cans from Central Park is 20/2=<<20/2=10>>10 trash cans.
After the addition of the 10 new cans, there are now 24+10=<<24+10=34>>34 trash cans in Veteran's Park.
#### 34

The total length cut from the 51-meter ribbon is 100 x 15 centimeters = <<100*15=1500>>1500 centimeters.
Since 1 meter is equal to 100 centimeters, then 1500 centimeters is equal to 1500/100 = <<1500/100=15>>15 meters.
Therefore, 51 - 15 = <<51-15=36>>36 meters of ribbon remains.

#### 5400

Each box of contacts is $100.00 with 10% off so that's 100*.10 = $<<100*.10=10.00>>10.00 off
So the box was $100.00 and he has $10.00 off so each box will cost 100-10 = $<<100-10=90.00>>90.00
He buys 2 boxes and each box costs $90.00 so that's 2*90= $<<2*90=180.00>>180.00
1 box of contacts has 90 contacts and he buys 2 boxes so that's 90*2 = <<90*2=180>>180 contacts
He needs 1 contact for each eye and he has 180 contacts so that's 180/2 = <<180/2=90>>90 pairs of contacts
He spent $180.00 to have 90 pairs of contacts so each pair of contacts costs 180/90 = $<<180/90=2.00>>2.00 a pair

Each apple costs $5.20/4 = $<<5.20/4=1.30>>1.30.
Each orange cost $3.30/3 = $<<3.30/3=1.10>>1.10.
So 5 apples cost $1.30 x 5 = $<<5*1.30=6.50>>6.50.
And 5 oranges cost $1.10 x 5 = $<<5*1.1=5.50>>5.50.
Thus, Clyde will pay $6.50 + $5.50 = $<<6.5+5.5=12>>12 for 5 apples and 5 oranges.
#### 12

The sausages take 5 minutes per sausage * 3 sausages = <<5*3=15>>15 minutes to cook.
The eggs take 4 minutes per egg * 6 eggs = <<4*6=24>>24 minutes to cook.

One year is 12 months, so during the first year, Kate spent $5/month * 12 months/year = $<<5*12=60>>60/year on the tickets.
After that, she went to the museum for 3 years - 1 year = <<3-1=2>>2 more years.
During this time, she visited the museum 2 years * 4 visits/year = <<2*4=8>>8 visits.
She had to pay the higher price of $7, so she spent $7/visit * 8 visits = $<<7*8=56>>56 in two last years.
In total Kate paid $56 + $60 = $<<56+60=116>>116 during 3 years.
#### 116

Since each package weighed 4 pounds, the first butcher delivered 10 * 4 = <<10*4=40>>40 pounds
The second butcher's delivery was 7 * 4 = <<7*4=28>>28 pounds
The first two butchers therefore delivered 40 + 28 = <<40+28=68>>68 pounds
Subtracting that weight from the total weight of ground beef gives 100 - 68 = <<100-68=32>>32 pounds
It therefore means the third butcher delivered 32/4 = <<32/4=8>>8 packages.

In inches, the height of the rim is 10*12 = <<10*12=120>>120 inches.
Thus, the height that the player needs to be able to reach is 120 + 6 = <<120+6=126>>126 inches.
Without jumping, the player can reach their height plus an additional 22 inches, or a total of 6*12 + 22 = <<6*12+22=94>>94 inches.
Therefore, the player needs to jump 126 - 94 = <<126-94=32>>32 inches to reach the height required to dunk a basketball.

First find the total weight of the big antacids: 2 grams/antacid * 2 antacids = <<2*2=4>>4 grams
Then convert that weight to milligrams: 4 grams * 1000 mg/gram = <<4*1000=4000>>4000 mg
Then multiply that number by 5% to find how much zinc is in the big antacids: 4000 mg * 5% = <<4000*5*.01=200>>200 mg
Then find the total weight of the smaller antacids in milligrams: 3 antacids * 1 gram/antacid * 1000 mg/gram = <<3*1*1000=3000>>3000 mg
Then multiply that number by the percent of zinc to find the amount of zinc in the small antacids: 3000 mg * 15% = 450 mg
Then add the zinc Jerry gets from each set of pills to find the total amount of zinc he eats: 450 mg + 200 mg = <<450+200=650>>650 mg

First find how many ounces of carbon dioxide are released per shopping trip: 8 bags/trip * 4 oz/bag = <<8*4=32>>32 oz/trip
Then divide that amount by the number of ounces per pound to find the pounds of carbon per shopping trip: 32 oz/trip / 16 oz/pound = <<32/16=2>>2 pounds/trip
Then divide the amount of carbon used to make the tote bag by the amount of carbon saved per shopping trip to find the number of trips needed for the bag to be a better option: 600 pounds / 2 pounds/trip = <<600/2=300>>300 trips

She wants 5 utensils at $5.00 each so they cost 5*5 = $<<5*5=25.00>>25.00
The utensils are $25, the pots and pans are $120 and the mixing bowls are $20 for a total of 25+120+20 = $<<25+120+20=165>>165
Everything is 20% off, and her total is $165 so 165*.20= $<<165*.20=33.00>>33.00
The total was $165 and she gets a $33.00 discount so 165-33 = $<<165-33=132.00>>132.00 is her total price

Saturday's total was 2*40-10=<<2*40-10=70>>70.
Sunday's was 70/2=<<70/2=35>>35.
The sum is 40+70+35=<<40+70+35=145>>145.

If the distance he took traveling to the East is 20 miles more than the distance he took to travel to the south, he took 40+20 = 60 miles traveling to the East.
Johny's total distance traveling to the south and then to the East is 60+40 = <<60+40=100>>100 miles.
The journey to the North was 2*60 = <<2*60=120>>120, twice the distance he took traveling to the East.
The whole journey took 100+120 = <<100+120=220>>220 miles.
