Let s be the number of cheerleaders who need a size 6 and t be the number who need a size 12. We know that s = 2t and s + t + 4 = 19.
Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 2t + t + 4 = 19
Combining like terms, we get 3t + 4 = 19
Subtracting 4 from both sides, we get 3t = 15
Dividing both sides by 3, we get t = 5
Substituting that value back into the equation s = 2t, we get s = 2 * 5 = <<2*5=10>>10

If rice weighed 30 kg less than the green beans, then the total rice weight is 60 kg - 30 kg = 30 kg
If the green beans weighed 10 kg more than sugar, then the total sugar weight is 60 kg - 10 kg = <<60-10=50>>50 kg
When 1/3 weight of rice was lost, the weight loss became 1/3*30 = <<1/3*30=10>>10kg
The weight of rice after the loss is 30 kg - 10 kg = <<30-10=20>>20 kg.
When 1/5 weight of sugar was lost, the lost weight was 1/5 * 50 kg = <<1/5*50=10>>10 kg
The weight of sugar after the loss is 50 kg - 10 kg = <<50-10=40>>40 kg.
The total weight for all the items is 40 kg + 20 kg + 60 kg = <<40+20+60=120>>120 kg

Elliott took half of his steps on his school journey, which was 10,000 steps / 2 = <<10000/2=5000>>5,000 steps.
Adding this to his short walk means he has taken 5,000 + 1,000 = <<6000=6000>>6,000 steps.
He only has 2,000 steps left, which means that during the day, he has taken 10,000 goal steps – 2,000 remaining steps = <<10000-2000=8000>>8,000 steps.
The difference between these is therefore the steps he took during his jog, which was 8,000 total steps – 6,000 steps on his school walks and short walks = <<8000-6000=2000>>2,000 steps.

First find the number of cheaper coats Karen will have to purchase over 30 years: 30 years / 5 years/coat = <<30/5=6>>6 coats
Then multiply that number by the cost of one cheaper coat to find the total cost of that option: 6 coats * $120/coat = $<<6*120=720>>720
Then find the number of more expensive coats Karen will have to purchase over 30 years: 30 years / 15 years/coat = <<30/15=2>>2 coats
Then multiply that number by the cost of one expensive coat to find the total cost of that option: 2 coats * $300/coat = $<<2*300=600>>600
Then subtract the total cost of the more expensive coats from the total cost of the less expensive coats to find the difference: $720 - $600 = $<<720-600=120>>120
#### 120

Ravi has 6 + 2 = <<6+2=8>>8 quarters.
He has also 8 + 4 = <<8+4=12>>12 dimes.
A nickel is worth 5 cents so Ravi's nickels amount to 6 x 5 = <<6*5=30>>30 cents.
A quarter is worth 25 cents so his quarters amount to 8 x 25 = <<8*25=200>>200 cents.
A dime is worth 10 cents so his dimes amount to 12 x 10 = <<12*10=120>>120 cents.
therefore, Ravi has 30 + 200 + 120 = <<30+200+120=350>>350 cents.

Let x be the percentage of watermelon that each adult gets.
Since each kid gets half of what each adult gets, each kid gets x/2 percent of the watermelon
So the watermelon gets split into 2*x and 4*(x/2) parts by percentage
The percentages have to sum up to 100 so 2x+2x = 100 (after simplification)
x = 100/4 = <<100/4=25>>25, which means each adult gets 25% of the watermelon.
#### 25

Heisenberg sells a total of $80/5= <<80/5=16>>16 capsules of 100 mg amoxicillin every week.

In total, Johnny has 15 + 6 = <<15+6=21>>21 red colored pencils.
#### 21

Abraham sold 1/2 x 80= <<1/2*80=40>>40 square meters of his unused land.
After a month, he sold 1/4 x 40 = <<1/4*40=10>>10 square meters of his land.
So, the total land he already sold is 40+10= <<50=50>>50 square meters of his land.
He has 80 - 50 = <<80-50=30>>30 remaining land to be sold at $3 per square meter.
So he earned $3 x 30 = $<<3*30=90>>90 for that land.
Therefore, he earned a total of $50 + $30 + $90 = $<<50+30+90=170>>170.
#### 170

Including the toilet paper, Monica and Sheila had already spent $12 + $24 = $<<12+24=36>>36
This means that they had $50 - $36 = $<<50-36=14>>14 left to spend on themselves.
However, the boots cost $14 x 3 = $<<14*3=42>>42 per pair.
Two pairs of boots would cost $42 x 2 = $<<42*2=84>>84
They need another $84 - $14 = $<<84-14=70>>70 to buy two pairs.
Each of them needs to add another $70/2 = $<<70/2=35>>35

For red tractors, 10% of the sales price is 10/100*$20,000 = $<<10/100*20000=2000>>2000.
By selling two red tractors, he earned 2*$2000 = $<<2*2000=4000>>4000.
Thus, of the $7000 salary he was paid this week, $7000-$4000 = $<<7000-4000=3000>>3000 is from sales of green tractors.
And since he sold three green tractors, the commission for the sale of a single green tractor is $3000/3=$<<3000/3=1000>>1000,
If $1000 is 20% of the full price, then the full price for a green tractor is (100/20)*$1000 = $5000.

He spends $10/snake * 4 snakes = $<<10*4=40>>40 to feed his snakes every month
He spends $5/iguana * 2 iguanas = $<<5*2=10>>10 to feed his iguanas every month
He spends $15/gecko * 3 geckos = $<<15*3=45>>45 to feed his geckos every month
So overall he spends $40 + $10 + $45 = $<<40+10+45=95>>95 to feed all his pets every month
Therefore every year pet food costs him $95/month * 12 months = $<<95*12=1140>>1140
#### 1140

1 minute is 60 seconds, so 4 minutes is 4 * 60 = <<4*60=240>>240 seconds.
During this time there would be 240 / 20 = <<240/20=12>>12 big crashes.
And also 240 / 10 = <<240/10=24>>24 car collisions.

Two pairs of shoes at $50 a pair costs $50 x 2 = $<<50*2=100>>100.
The shoes are discounted by 40 percent so she only pays 100 - 40 = <<100-40=60>>60 percent of the original price.
Therefore the two pairs of shoes cost $100 x 0.60 = $<<100*0.60=60>>60.
The dress is discounted by 20 percent so she only pays 100 - 20 = <<100-20=80>>80 percent of the original price.
Therefore the dress costs $100 x 0.80 = $<<100*0.80=80>>80.

There are a total of 1000 spaces - 320 spaces = <<1000-320=680>>680 spaces in both sections 2 and 3.
Let the number of spaces in section 3 be x. The number of spaces in section 2 = x + 200.
We know that 320 + x + 200 + x = 1000.
Combining like terms, we get 2x = 480
Dividing both sides by 2 produces x = 240.
The number of spaces in section 2 is 240 + 200 = <<240+200=440>>440.

If my total bill was $66 and I spent $6 on oranges then I spent $66 - $6 = $<<66-6=60>>60 on the other 2 fruit types.
Assuming the price of watermelon is W, and knowing that you can buy 4 apples for the same price and that the price of one apple is A, then 1W=4A
If we know we bought 12 watermelons and 12 apples for $60, then we know that $60 = 12W + 12A
Knowing that 1W=4A, then we can convert the above to $60 = 12(4A) + 12A
$60 = 48A + 12A
$60 = <<60=60>>60A
Then we know the price of one apple (A) is $60/60= $<<60/60=1>>1

The house is 2,300 sq ft and we know the non-bedroom sections take up 1,000 sq ft, so that leaves 2300-1000 = <<2300-1000=1300>>1,300 sq ft for the bedrooms/bathrooms
Let x be the size of the master bedroom suite.
Then the guest bedroom is 0.25x.
So together the bedrooms are x + 0.25x = 1.25x in size.
This means 1.25x = 1300
So x = 1300 / 1.25 = <<1300/1.25=1040>>1040 sq ft
#### 1040

First find the number of minutes in 2 hours: 2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = <<2*60=120>>120 minutes
Then add 10 minutes to that amount to find the total number of minutes Walter spent at the zoo: 120 minutes + 10 minutes = <<120+10=130>>130 minutes
Let s be the amount of time he spends looking at the seals and p be the amount of time he spends looking at the penguins. From the problem, we know that s + p + 13 = 130 and p = 8s.
Substituting the second equation into the first, we get s + 8s + 13 = 130
Combining like terms, we get 9s + 13 = 130
Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get 9s = 117
Dividing both sides by 9, we get s = 13

Joanna gathered 30 apples / 2 = <<30/2=15>>15 apples from the shortest trees.
Her sister gathered 30 apples * 2 = <<30*2=60>>60 apples from the tallest trees.
Her sister also gathered 15 apples * 3 = <<15*3=45>>45 apples from the shortest trees.
In total, her sister gathered 60 + 45 = <<60+45=105>>105 apples.
From the tallest and shortest trees, Joanna gathered 30 + 15 = <<30+15=45>>45 apples.
So far, the sisters have a combined total of 105 + 45 = <<105+45=150>>150 apples.
Therefore, Joanna must have gathered 500 total apples – 150 apples so far = <<500-150=350>>350 apples from the average trees.

Since Mary first weighed 99 pounds, after she dropped a dozen pounds she weighed 99-12=<<99-12=87>>87 pounds.
Twice the weight she initially lost is 12*2=<<12*2=24>>24 pounds.
So, when she added back twice the weight that she initially lost, her weight jumped to 87+24=<<87+24=111>>111 pounds.
Three times more than she initially had lost is 12*3=<<12*3=36>>36 pounds.
Therefore, when Mary lost 3 times more than she initially lost, her weight dropped to 111-36=<<111-36=75>>75 pounds.
Finally, when Mary gained back half of a dozen pounds, her final weight was 75+6=<<75+6=81>>81 pounds.

First, the shop is open 12 hours * 60 minutes = <<12*60=720>>720 minutes per day.
So, 720 / 30 = <<720/30=24>>24 women's T-shirts sold per day.
The shop earns 24 * $18 = $<<24*18=432>>432 selling women's T-shirts per day.
Similarly, 720 / 40 = <<720/40=18>>18 men's T-shirts are sold per day.
The shop earns 18 * $15 = $<<18*15=270>>270 selling men's T-shirts per day.
The shop earns $432 + $270 = $<<432+270=702>>702 per day selling T-shirts.
The shop earns $702 * 7 = $<<702*7=4914>>4914 per week.

On 80 games, Daniel spend 80 games * $12/game = $<<80*12=960>>960.
The rest of the collection is 346 games - 80 games = <<346-80=266>>266 games.
50% of these games means 50/100 * 266 games = <<50/100*266=133>>133 games.
Daniel bought them for $7 each, so he had to spend 133 games * $7/game = $<<133*7=931>>931 on them.
The other 133 games were bought for $3 each, so they've cost him 133 games * $3/game = $<<133*3=399>>399.
On all games in total Daniel spent $960 + $931 + $399 = $<<960+931+399=2290>>2290.

First we must determine the percentage of the grey and green stones. We add the two amounts together, finding 40+60=<<40+60=100>>100
We then figure out that 40/100=<<40/100=.4>>.4, meaning 40 percent of the stones are grey in the second selection.
This means that 1.0-.4= <<1.0-.4=.6>>.6, or 60 percent of the stones are green.
Since there are more green stones than grey stones, and the white and black pile have the same percentage, and there are more white stones than black stones, that means there are 60 percent white stones in the first pile.
Therefore, to find the number of white stones we multiply 100*.6= 60 white stones.

Phill starts with 1 pizza, cutting it in half. This means he now has 1*2=<<1*2=2>>2 slices of pizza.
He cuts each of these 2 slices in half, meaning he now has 2*2= <<2*2=4>>4 slices of pizza.
He then cuts these in half again, meaning he now has 4*2= <<4*2=8>>8 slices of pizza.
Phill hands out 2 slices to 2 of his friends, meaning he gave out 2*2= <<2*2=4>>4 slices
He hands out 1 slice to 3 others, so the total amount of slices handed out are 3+4=7 slices.
Since Phill started with 8 slices, this means he has 8-7= <<8-7=1>>1 slice remaining.
