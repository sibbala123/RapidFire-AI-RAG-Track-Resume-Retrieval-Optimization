First you must recognize that the problem involves finding the rate of how fast Ms. Alice can grade papers. To find how many papers she can grade in 11 hours, it would be useful to first find out how many papers she can grade in one hour. To do so, divide 296 papers by 8 hours, 296/8, to get 37. Therefore, Ms. Alice can grade 37 papers in one hour.
To find out how many papers she can grade in 11 hours, multiply the number of papers she can grade in one hour by 11. 37 * 11 gives you <<37*11=407>>407. Ms. Alice can grade 407 papers in 11 hours.

First, the initial, pre-inflation, cost of the project was 450 + 30 + 80 = $<<450+30+80=560>>560.
Then, the price of the lumber increased to 450*1.20 = $<<450*1.20=540>>540.
Similarly, the price of the nails increased to 30*1.10 = $<<30*1.10=33>>33.
And the price of the fabric increased to 80*1.05 = $<<80*1.05=84>>84.
Therefore, the new, post-inflation, cost of the project is 540 + 33 + 84 = $<<540+33+84=657>>657.
Thus, the cost has increased by 657 - 560 = $<<657-560=97>>97.

First find half the number of guests at Carly's party: 30 guests / 2 = <<30/2=15>>15 guests
Then multiply that number by 2 for the number of burgers half the guests want: 15 guests * 2 burgers/guest = <<15*2=30>>30 burgers
Then add the 15 burgers for the 15 guests who only want 1 to find the total number of burgers: 30 burgers + 15 burgers = 45 burgers
Then divide the total number of burgers by the number of burgers Carly can cook at once to find the number of batches she cooks: 45 burgers / 5 burgers/batch = <<45/5=9>>9 batches
Then multiply the number of sides per burger by the cooking time per side to find each burger's total cook time: 4 minutes/side * 2 sides = <<4*2=8>>8 minutes
Finally, multiply each batch's cook time by the number of batches to find the total cook time: 8 minutes/batch * 9 batches = <<8*9=72>>72 minutes

If the house has twice the number of large ones as medium ones then the house has 2*12 = <<2*12=24>>24 large ceiling lights
Similarly, if it has 10 more small ones than the 12 medium ones then it has 10+12 = <<10+12=22>>22 small ceiling lights
If one small ceiling light requires 1 bulb then 22 small ones will require 1*22 = <<1*22=22>>22 bulbs
If one medium ceiling light requires 2 bulbs then 12 medium ones will require 2*12 = <<2*12=24>>24 bulbs
If one large ceiling light requires 3 bulbs then 24 medium ones will require 3*24 = <<3*24=72>>72 bulbs
Therefore the house will require 22 bulbs for the small ones + 24 bulbs for the medium ones + 72 bulbs for the large ones, for a total of 22+24+72=<<22+24+72=118>>118

First find the total number of weeks the Bobbit worm preys on the fish: 2 weeks + 1 week = <<2+1=3>>3 weeks
Then multiply that number by the number of days per week: 3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days
Then multiply that number by the number of fish the worm eats per day to find how many fish it eats total: 21 days * 2 fish/day = <<21*2=42>>42 fish
Then add the number of fish James adds to the starting number of fish to find the ending number of fish: 60 fish + 8 fish = <<60+8=68>>68 fish
Then subtract the number of eaten fish to find the number of surviving fish: 68 fish - 42 fish = <<68-42=26>>26 fish

We need to count the sequences that Tobias made, which consist of 25 minutes of swimming and a 5-minute pause, so one sequence lasts for 25 minutes + 5 minutes = <<25+5=30>>30 minutes/sequence.
Three hours is 3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes, so he is able to make 180 minutes / 30 minutes/sequence = <<180/30=6>>6 sequences.
Therefore Tobias needs to make 6 pauses within these 6 sequences, which will last for 6 pauses * 5 minutes/pause = <<6*5=30>>30 minutes.
During three hours, he is going to swim for 180 minutes - 30 minutes = <<180-30=150>>150 minutes.
Therefore Tobias can make 100 meters for 150 minutes / 5 minutes/100 meters = 3 times.
So he was able to swim 30 times * 100 meters/time = <<30*100=3000>>3000 meters in total.

We know Paul would get $5 for a B+. However, we know this could be (2x) doubled if he obtains at least two A+. This means 2*$5 = $<<2*5=10>>10 for a B+ if Paul gets at least two A+
We know Paul would get twice the reward of a B+ if he gets an A. This means 2*$5 = $<<5*2=10>>10 for every A
However, we know his reward for every A could be (2x) doubled if he obtains at least two A+. This means 2*$10 = $<<2*10=20>>20 for every A if Paul gets at least two A+
We learn here then that Paul will get a higher reward for obtaining A grades ($20) than getting A+ grades ($15) as long as he's able to score at least two A+.
To maximize his payout, Paul will need to get only (2) two A+ from his 10 courses. Therefore he should aim to get an A in the remaining 10-2 = <<10-2=8>>8 courses
Assuming Paul can get two A+ and eight A in his next scorecard his total payout would be 2*$15 + 8*$20
This translates into $30 + $160 or $<<30+160=190>>190
#### 190

She has 24 classmates and wants to give each 10 cookies, so she needs to bake 24*10=<<24*10=240>>240 cookies

She baked 2 batches of chocolate chip and one batch of oatmeal raisin so 2+1 = <<2+1=3>>3 batches
We know that each batch has 48 cookies so 3*48 = <<3*48=144>>144 cookies have been baked
She needs to have 240 cookies and has baked 144 so 240-144 = <<240-144=96>>96 cookies are needed
Again, each batch makes 48 cookies and we need 96 more cookies so 96/48 = <<96/48=2>>2 more batches are needed

The six T-shirts cost 6 x $8 = $<<6*8=48>>48.
The four sweaters cost 4 x $18 = $<<4*18=72>>72.
And five jackets normally cost 5 x $80 = $<<5*80=400>>400.
So, a discount of 10/100 x $400 = $<<10/100*400=40>>40 for the five jackets.
Thus, the selling price of the five jackets is $400 - $40 = $<<400-40=360>>360.
Hence, the total cost of all the items is $48 + $72 + $360 = $<<48+72+360=480>>480.
The sales tax is equal to 5/100 x $480 = $<<5/100*480=24>>24.

If b is the length of the body, h is the length of the head, and t is the length of the tail, we know that b + h + t = 30, h = b/6 and t = b/2. We can substitute the second two equations into the first equation to get b + b/6 + b/2 = 30
Now multiply both sides of this equation by 6: 6b + b + 3b = 180
Now combine like terms: 10b = 180
Now divide both sides by 10: b = 180.
The dog's body is 18 inches long. Now divide that length by 2 to find the length of its tail: 18 inches / 2 = <<18/2=9>>9 inches

Ada's weekly electric consumption before adding the new device is 12 x 7 = <<12*7=84>>84.
So, her weekly electric bill is 84 x $1.50 = $<<84*1.5=126>>126.
Ada's daily electric consumption after adding the new device is 12 + 2 = <<12+2=14>>14.
So her weekly electric consumption after adding the new device is 14 x 7= <<14*7=98>>98 kilowatts per hour.
Ada's new electric bill per week will be 98 x $1.50 = $<<98*1.5=147>>147
Therefore, the difference between the bill before and after she adds the new device is $147 - $126 = $<<147-126=21>>21.

The bus started with 50 people – 15 who got off at the first stop = <<50-15=35>>35 people on the bus.
At the second stop, 35 people on the bus – 8 who got off = <<35-8=27>>27 people.
Then there were 27 people + 2 who got on = <<27+2=29>>29 people on the bus.
At the third stop, 29 people on the bus – 4 who got off = <<29-4=25>>25 people on the bus.
Then there were 25 people on the bus + 3 who got on = <<25+3=28>>28 people on the bus.

Let x be the number of plates removed from the box.
Hasan figured out the movers' weight limit was 20 pounds. Since a pound is equal to 16 ounces, each box can hold 20 * 16, or <<20*16=320>>320 ounces.
Each plate weighs 10 ounces, so the weight of the plates in the box after Hasan removes enough plates to satisfy the movers' weight limit is (38 - x) * 10 ounces
Since these two values are equal, we can write the equation (38 - x) * 10 = 320.
Dividing both sides by 10 leaves 38-x = 32.
Adding x to both sides gives 38 – x + x = 32 +x, or, 38 = 32 +x
Subtracting 32 from both sides gives the value of x, which is the number of plates removed from the box, 38 -32 = 32 + x – 32, or, 6 = x

For the first set of walls, each wall covers 3 meters wide * 2 meters tall = <<3*2=6>>6 square meters.
There are two of these walls, so this becomes a total of 6 meters * 2 walls = <<6*2=12>>12 square meters.
The third wall covers 5 meters wide * 2 meters tall = <<5*2=10>>10 square meters.
The final wall covers 4 meters wide * 2 meters tall = <<4*2=8>>8 square meters.
So in total, the paint needs to cover 12 + 10 + 8 = <<12+10+8=30>>30 metres.
Since each can covers 2 meters, Lucille needs 30 meters / 2 = <<30/2=15>>15 cans of paint.

Tara has to make a $1000 x 20/100 = $<<1000*20/100=200>>200 down payment.
Since Tara wants to pay $20 more for the down payment, her total down payment will be $200 + $20 = $<<200+20=220>>220.
So her remaining balance payable over a year is $1000 - $220 = $<<1000-220=780>>780.
Tara has to make a monthly payment of $780/year / 12 months/year = $<<780/12=65>>65/month.
The total cost of her payments for 4 months is $65/month x 4 months = $<<65*4=260>>260.
Therefore, Tara's balance after 4 months is $780 - $260 = $<<780-260=520>>520.

First, figure out how many total treats Carly made for her class by multiplying the number of people in the class by the number of treats per person: 5 people * 2 treats/person = <<5*2=10>>10 treats
Next, express the number of brownies in terms of the number of cupcakes based on the problem information: b = 3c - 2, where b is the number of brownies and c is the number of cupcakes
We know that b + c = 10, the total number of treats, so now we can substitute in the expression for b from the last step: 3c - 2 + c = 10
Now we combine like terms to get 4c - 2 = 10
We add two to both sides of the equation to get 4c = 12
Finally, we divide both sides by 4 to get c = 3

Therefore, she has 1000 - 250 = <<1000-250=750>>750 grams of rice left.
#### 750

Adam gave away 18/3 = <<18/3=6>>6 magnets.
Adam had 18-6 = <<18-6=12>>12 magnets left.
Peter has 12*2 = <<12*2=24>>24 magnets.

Jake earns $6 * 3 = $<<6*3=18>>18 per hour.
Working, 8 hour in a day, he earns $18 * 8 = $<<8*18=144>>144.
So in 5 days, Jake earns $144 x 5 = $<<144*5=720>>720.
#### 720

She had 8 records, received 12 and bought 30 for a total of 8+12+30 = <<8+12+30=50>>50 records
It takes 2 days to listen to 1 record and she has 50 records it will take her 2*50 = <<2*50=100>>100 days
#### 100

If Jacob has 18 hours left to finish his homework, Greg has 18-6 = <<18-6=12>>12 hours left to finish his homework.
The total number of hours Jacob and Greg have left to finish their homework is 12+18 = <<12+18=30>>30 hours.
Patrick has 4 hours less than twice Greg has left to finish his homework, meaning Patrick has 4 hours less than 12*2 = 24 hours left to finish his homework.
Patrick has 24-4 = <<24-4=20>>20 hours left to finish his homework.
Altogether, the three have 30+20 = <<30+20=50>>50 hours left to finish their homework.
#### 50

She drinks 1/2 bottle a day and there are 24 bottles in a case so a case will last 24/.5 = <<24/.5=48>>48 days
She needs enough to last her 240 days and 1 case will last her 48 days so she needs 240/48 = <<240/48=5>>5 cases
Each case is on sale for $12.00 and she needs 5 cases so that's 12*5 = $<<12*5=60.00>>60.00

Paul doubles the amount that he ate on the second day, so eats 2 x 2 = <<2*2=4>>4 sandwiches.
For the third day, he doubles the number of sandwiches he ate on the second day, so eats 2 x 2 x 2 = <<2*2*2=8>>8 sandwiches.
To get the total amount of sandwiches he ate over three days it's necessary to add up the amount he ate each day: 2 + 4 + 8 = <<2+4+8=14>>14 sandwiches
Since he eats 14 sandwiches every 3 days, then in 6 days he would eat 14 x 2 = <<14*2=28>>28 sandwiches in total.
#### 28

Max bought 16 + 3 = <<16+3=19>>19 truck stamps.
Max bought 19 – 9 = <<19-9=10>>10 rose stamps.
In total Max bought 16 snowflake + 19 truck + 10 rose stamps = <<16+19+10=45>>45 stamps.

Mikaela spent 35 + 5 = <<35+5=40>>40 hours in the second month.
So, she tutored a total of 35 + 40 = <<35+40=75>>75 hours for the first two months.
Thus, her total earning was 75 x $10 = $<<75*10=750>>750.
And, her total expenses was 4/5 x $750 = $<<4/5*750=600>>600.
Therefore, she saved an amount of $750 - $600 = $<<750-600=150>>150.
#### 150

So the total number of streetlights that will be used is 15 squares * 12 streetlights/square = <<15*12=180>>180 streetlights
There will be 200 streetlights - 180 streetlights = <<200-180=20>>20 streetlights unused.
#### 20

The total number of slices is 3 × 8 = <<3*8=24>>24.
Every one of the colleagues gets 24 / 12 = <<24/12=2>>2 slices per person.

Anne is 2 times as tall as her sister hence 2*(her sister's height) = 80cm
Her sister's height = 80cm/2 = <<80/2=40>>40cm
Bella is 3 times as tall as Anne hence Bella's height is 3*80 cm = <<3*80=240>>240 cm
The height difference between Bella and Anne's sister = 240-40 = <<240-40=200>>200cm
#### 200

If Kimiko is 28, Omi is 2 * 28 years = <<28*2=56>>56 years old.
Arlette is 3/4 * 28 years = <<3/4*28=21>>21 years old.
If you add up their ages, it sums to 21 years + 56 years + 28 years = <<21+56+28=105>>105 years
The average age for the three is 105 years / 3 people = <<105/3=35>>35 years/person
