Since 80% of the people were adults, this means 100% - 80% = 20 % were children.
20% of the people vaccinated were children. The number of children is 20% of 650.
20% = 0.2, so 0.2 * 650 = <<0.2*650=130>>130 children were vaccinated.

The town used to emit 800 pounds of carbon a year because 80 x 10 = <<80*10=800>>800
20 now take the bus because 80 x .25 = <<80*.25=20>>20
60 people still drive because 80 - 20 = <<80-20=60>>60
Those 60 people create 600 pounds of carbon because 60 x 10 = <<60*10=600>>600
The town now emits 700 pounds of carbon because 100 + 600 = <<100+600=700>>700
The town emits 100 fewer pounds of carbon now because 800 - 700 = <<800-700=100>>100

On the first day Chandra saw 2 monsters and on day 2 she saw twice that amount, 2 x 2 = <<2+2=4>>4 monsters seen on day 2.
On day 3 she saw double that amount of monsters, 4 x 2 = <<4*2=8>>8.
On day 4 she saw double that amount of monsters, 8 x 2 = <<8*2=16>>16.
On day 5 she saw double that amount of monsters, 16 x 2 = <<16*2=32>>32.
Altogether Chandra saw 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 lost monsters = <<2+4+8+16+32=62>>62 total lost monsters that Chandra needs to lead back to the swamps.

Sam bought 12 boxes x $10 = $<<12*10=120>>120 worth of highlighters.
He bought 12 * 30 = <<12*30=360>>360 highlighters in total.
Sam then took 5 boxes × 6 highlighters/box = <<5*6=30>>30 highlighters.
He sold these boxes for 5 * $3 = $<<5*3=15>>15
After selling these 5 boxes there were 360 - 30 = <<360-30=330>>330 highlighters remaining.
These form 330 / 3 = <<330/3=110>>110 groups of three pens.
He sold each of these groups for $2 each, so made 110 * 2 = $<<110*2=220>>220 from them.
In total, then, he earned $220 + $15 = $<<220+15=235>>235.
Since his original cost was $120, he earned $235 - $120 = $<<235-120=115>>115 in profit.
#### 115

Stephanie has paid three-quarters of her gas bill, which is 40 * 0.75 = $<<40*0.75=30>>30.
She then made another payment, which means she has paid 30 + 5 =$<<30+5=35>>35 of her gas bill.
She has paid half of her water bill, which is 40 * 0.5 = $<<40*0.5=20>>20.
She has made 4 payments towards her internet bill, which is a total of 4 * 5 = $<<4*5=20>>20.
Overall, her bills were 60 + 40 + 40 + 25 = $<<60+40+40+25=165>>165.
Overall, she has made payments of 60 + 35 + 20 + 20 = $<<60+35+20+20=135>>135.
Therefore, she still has to pay 165 – 135 = $<<165-135=30>>30.

Half the floors are full, so there are 12 floors * 0.5 = <<12*0.5=6>>6 floors that are full.
So the full floors contain 6 floors * 10 apartments = <<6*10=60>>60 apartments.
The remaining floors are at half-capacity, so there are 12 floors – 6 full floors = <<12-6=6>>6 half-full floors.
Each of these floors therefore contains 10 apartments * 0.5 = <<10*0.5=5>>5 apartments.
So on the half-full floors, there are a total of 6 floors * 5 apartments = <<6*5=30>>30 apartments.
In total, there are 30 + 60 = <<30+60=90>>90 filled apartments in the building.
This means there are 90 apartments * 4 people per apartment = <<90*4=360>>360 people in the building.

Checking each possibility, we can see that dividing each pizza into 6 slices yields 5*6 = 30 total slices, dividing each pizza into 8 slices yields 5*8 = 40 total slices, and dividing each pizza into 10 slices yields 5*10 = 50 total slices.
Because each child must receive the same number of slices, the total number of slices must be evenly divisible by 20.
The only option that satisfies this requirement is dividing the pizza into 8 slices, as 40/20 = 2 slices per child. Therefore, the mother should divide each pizza into 8 slices.

Let s be the number of guests who want steak and c be the number who want chicken. We know that s + c = 80 and s = 3c.
Substituting the second equation into the first equation, we get 3c + c = 80
Combining like terms, we get 4c = 80
Dividing both sides by 4, we get c = 20
Then multiply the number of guests who want chicken by the cost of each chicken entree: 20 guests * $18/guest = $<<20*18=360>>360
Then triple the number of guests who want chicken to find the number who want steak: 20 guests * 3 = <<20*3=60>>60 guests
Then multiply the number of guests who want steak by the cost of each steak entree: 60 guests * $25/guest = $<<60*25=1500>>1500
Then add the cost of the steak and chicken entrees to find the total cost: $1500 + $360 = $<<1500+360=1860>>1860
#### 1860

Let x be the number of minutes it takes Yolanda's husband to catch her.
We know that Yolanda will spend a total of x + 15 minutes riding her bike since she left 15 minutes before her husband.
The distance each person travels is equal to their travel speed times the number of minutes they spend traveling. That means Yolanda's distance is equal to 20 mph * (x + 15) and her husband's distance is equal to 40 mph * x
Yolanda's husband catches up to her when they've both traveled the same distance, which is when 20(x + 15) = 40x
We can simplify this equation by multiplying 20 through the parentheses to get 20x + 300 = 40x
Then we can subtract 20x from each side to get 300 = 20x
Finally, we divide both sides by 20 to find that x = 15.

In three years, Harriet will be 21+3 = <<21+3=24>>24 years old.
Since Adrian's age is three times that of Harriet, Adrian is 3*21 = <<3*21=63>>63 years old.
In three years, he will be 63+3 =<<63+3=66>>66 years old.
If Harriet is half times the age of Zack, Zack is 21*2 = <<21*2=42>>42 years old.
In three years, he will be 42+3 = <<42+3=45>>45 years old.
The combined age of the three in 3 years will be 45+66+24 = <<45+66+24=135>>135 years.

Brian begins by watching a 4-minute video, and since the second video is twice as long that means the second video is 4*2= <<4*2=8>>8 minutes.
The first two videos combined therefore for a 4+8=<<4+8=12>>12 minute run time.
Since the third video is twice as long as the first two videos put together, that means it is 12*2=<<12*2=24>>24 minutes in length.
The total length of time spent is therefore 24+12= <<24+12=36>>36 minutes

From the children, there are a total of 11 children * 4 items of clothing each = <<11*4=44>>44 items of clothing on the clotheslines.
From the adults, there are a total of 20 adults * 3 items of clothing each = <<20*3=60>>60 items of clothing on the clotheslines.
So there are a total of 44 + 60 = <<44+60=104>>104 items of clothing on the clotheslines.
This means that there are 104 items of clothing / 2 items of clothing per clothesline = <<104/2=52>>52 clotheslines.
There are 2 clotheslines per house so there must be 52 clotheslines / 2 = <<52/2=26>>26 houses on the street.

Let Z be the ounces of zest Tanya uses.
Tanya uses the same amount of fragrance as zest, so she uses Z + Z = 2Z fragrance and zest.
She uses twice as much salt as zest, so she uses 2Z salt.
She uses the same amount of sugar as salt, so she uses 2Z + 2Z + 2Z = <<2+2+2=6>>6Z fragrance, zest, salt, and sugar.
She uses twice as much oil as salt, so she uses 2 * 2Z = <<2*2=4>>4Z oil.
In all, she uses 6Z + 4Z = 10Z = <<6+4=10>>10 ounces of fragrance, zest, salt, sugar, and oil.
Thus, she uses Z = 10 / 10 = <<10/10=1>>1 ounce of zest.
Thus, Tanya uses 4Z = <<4=4>>4 ounces of oil.

In the second month, Vinny lost half as much as he had the first month, so he lost 20 pounds / 2 = <<20/2=10>>10 pounds.
In the third month, he again lost half as much which was 10 pounds / 2 = <<10/2=5>>5 pounds.
And in the fourth month, he lost 5 pounds / 2 = <<5/2=2.5>>2.5 pounds.
So in total, Vinny lost 20 + 10 + 5 + 2.5 = <<20+10+5+2.5=37.5>>37.5 pounds in the first four months.
Over his entire diet, he had lost 300 – 250.5 = <<300-250.5=49.5>>49.5 pounds.
So in the fifth month, Vinny must have lost 49.5 pounds total loss – 37.5 pounds loss in the first four months = 12 pounds.

Jeremy is driving 600 miles, at an average speed of 50 miles per hour, so he will be driving for 600 miles / 50 miles per hour = 12 hours * 60 minutes per hour = 720 minutes.
He makes a rest stop every 2 hours of driving, at 2, 4, 6, 8 & 10 hours in = 5 rest stops on the trips.
Each rest stop takes 15 minutes so he will spend 5 rest stops * 15 minutes per rest stop = <<5*15=75>>75 minutes on rest stops.
His car gets 18 miles to the gallon, and he stops to refill every 15 gallons, so he will stop to refill every 18 miles per gallon * 15 gallons = <<18*15=270>>270 miles.
600 miles / 270 miles per refuel = 2.22 refuels, so he'll only make 2 refuels during the trip.
He will spend 2 refuels * 10 minute per refuel = <<2*10=20>>20 minutes refueling his car.
In total he will take 720 minutes driving + 75 minutes resting + 20 minutes refueling = <<720+75+20=815>>815 minutes.
#### 815

He was running for 4-1=<<4-1=3>>3 hours
So in that time he runs 3*25=<<3*25=75>>75 miles
Since he slowed down after 4 hours, the time he spent running at 25mph was an additional 4-3=<<4-3=1>>1 hours
So in the first hour they were finding him, he ran 1*25=<<1*25=25>>25 miles
In the second hour they were finding him, he ran 1*10=<<1*10=10>>10 miles
Finally, during the chase, he ran 50*.5=<<50*.5=25>>25 miles
So he is 75+25+10+25=<<75+25+10+25=135>>135 miles away

In her old company, if she worked for three years, the total number of months she was paid for is 3 years*12, which is the number of months in a year = <<3*12=36>>36 months.
If each month she was paid $5000, her total earnings in the old company were $5000* 36 =$<<5000*36=180000>>180000
In her new company, she is paid 20% more, which is 20/100*$5000 = $<<20/100*5000=1000>>1000 per month more than what she was paid at the old company.
In total, she earns $5000+$1000 = $<<5000+1000=6000>>6000 per month in her new company.
Since she's worked five months more in the new company than the old company, she has worked for 36+5 = <<36+5=41>>41 months in the new company.
The total amount she's earned in the new company is $6000*41 = $<<6000*41=246000>>246000
The combined total for both companies is $246000+$180000 = $<<246000+180000=426000>>426000
